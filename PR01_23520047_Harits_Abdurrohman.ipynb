    "> *Photo editing or most likely known as photo manipulation is a process of transforming or altering an image (photograph) by using methods in image processing. The photo manipulation itself existed after the early invention of photographs around the 1820s. Back in that years, photo manipulation can be achieved in the printing process or during development. In 1840 Hippolyte Bayard, one of the famous pioneers in the history of photography makes the first photo manipulation known as ‘Self Portrait as a Drowned Man’. In his photo, Bayard portraits himself while pretends committed suicide. Another well-known photo manipulation in the early year of the photograph (around 1860s) is a photo of Abraham Lincoln that was altered using the portrait of John C. Calhoun as his body and Mathew Brady as his head Many famous photo manipulation in the 18th century is done by retouching. By the time, photo manipulation becomes popular. In the 20th century, digitalization of photo manipulation comes with Paintbox in Quantel computers, later replaced in the market by other editing software like Adobe Photoshop. An existing photo manipulation software recently brings innovation in entertainment, journalism, the fashion industry, ethics until politics. Including in radiologist terms of enhancing the image.*\n",

    "Entity masking ada proses mengubah suatu kata menjadi label/kategori dari entitas. Sebagai contoh, nama orang akan diganti menjadi label 'PEOPLE' atau NOUN. Nltk tidak secara langsung menyediakan fungsi ini, maka pendekatan yang bisa dilakukan adalah menggunakan fungsi NER atau Named Entity Recognition. NER ini membantu untuk mengenali apakah kata tersebut merupakan entitas atau bukan.

       "'Photo editing or most likely known as photo manipulation is a process of transforming or altering an image ( photograph ) by using methods in image processing . The photo manipulation itself existed after the early invention of photographs around the 1820s . Back in that years , photo manipulation can be achieved in the printing process or during development . In 1840 PERSON PERSON , one of the famous pioneers in the history of photography makes the first photo manipulation known as ‘ Self Portrait as a Drowned Man ’ . In his photo , PERSON portraits himself while pretends committed suicide . Another well-known photo manipulation in the early year of the photograph ( around 1860s ) is a photo of PERSON PERSON that was altered using the portrait of PERSON PERSON PERSON as his body and PERSON PERSON as his head Many famous photo manipulation in the 18th century is done by retouching . By the time , photo manipulation becomes popular . In the 20th century , digitalization of photo manipulation comes with Paintbox in ORGANIZATION computers , later replaced in the market by other editing software like Adobe Photoshop . An existing photo manipulation software recently brings innovation in entertainment , journalism , the fashion industry , ethics until politics . Including in radiologist terms of enhancing the image '"
