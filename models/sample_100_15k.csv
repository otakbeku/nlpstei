Said tonight there's gonna be a party goin' on

Then you'll make it your business to be right there""

He said: There's one more thing that I'm gonna guarantee
(Over at Mary's place, ho)
Got to have fun if you're a man like me

Sam Cooke,Another Saturday Night,Blues,"Let me tell you 'bout a place
Somewhere up-a New-York way
Where the people are so gay
Twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Puttin' trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young

They're twistin', twistin', everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Here's a man in evenin' clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twistin' the night away-ay
He's dancin' with the chick in slacks
She's a-movin' up and back
Oh man, there ain't nothin' like
Twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Let's twist a while!
Lean up, lean back
Lean up, lean back
Watusi, now fly, now twist
They're twistin' the night away
Here's a fella in bluejeans
Dancin' with a older Queen
Who's dolled up in-a diamond rings and
Twistin' the night away-ay
Man, you oughta see her go
Twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', man, everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away

Carole King,Where You Lead,Blues,"Wanting you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
Cause darling to me that's what you're worth

Chorus

Where you lead
I will follow
Anywhere, that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow
Where you lead

If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there
On the next train

Chorus

I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you wanna live in New York City
Honey, you know I will
(yes I will, yes I will)

I never thought I could get satisfaction
From just one man
But if anyone could keep me happy
You're the one who can

Treats me good like a lover should.

Stevie Wonder,Sir Duke,Blues,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands

But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people [Repeat]

Can't you feel it all over

You can feel it all over

Some joker got lucky, stole her back again
You better come on in my kitchen babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Oh, she's gone, I know she won't come back
I've taken the last nickel out of her nation sack

(Spoken: Oh, can't you hear that wind howl?)
Can't you hear that wind howl?
You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down
Lookin' for her good friend, none can't be found
You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Winter time's comin', it's goin' to be slow
You can make the winter, babe, that's dry long so
You better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors",172

It's so good to talk to you again.
It's been a long long time
cant' explain why you crossed my mind
I guess it's just to wish you a merry christmas

My best friend's having a party
and everybody's going
I know it's gonna be alot of fun - oh by the way
it's snowing

It's been a long long time
cant' explain why you crossed my mind
I guess it's just to say gee whiz it's christmas

It's funny that I have'nt thought to call you before
And why is it i haven't seen you around anymore
another year has passed and i can't erase
the memory of your smiling face
so i have to call you up and say
gee whiz it's christmas

so don't forget the party that we're throwing
the warm fires of the fireplace
will be glowing
It's been a long long time
still cant' figure out why you crossed my mind
I guess it's just to say gee whiz it's christmas

Stevie Wonder,Ordinary Pain,Blues,"When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart

When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
Tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
Tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart

Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head

But like a play boy you said no

Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But then I blew you out the box

Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
I knew our love would have to end

But in this lovie-dovie game
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
With all it's joy there must be pain
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But now the time has surely come
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
This game don't seem like so much fun
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You're crying big crocodile tears
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
When I was home waiting for you
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You were out somewhere doing the do
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
You know I'd really like to stay

You're dumb to think I'd let you be
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Scott free without some pain from me
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
I heard your song and took a chance
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
But to your music I can't dance
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
About you blowin what you had
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Since one ain't good enough for you
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain
Then do yourself see how you do
Ordinary pain, ordinary pain

She knows all the honkies
And the kids are all home in bed

Than anything else instead

I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky

I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky

She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the TV screen
She takes another puff and says it's a crazy scene
That red is green
She's a tangerine

I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground

I'm too high
I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down

She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
She wasn't very nice

I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky

I'm too high
I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die

I guess that I got to her at last
Did you hear the news about the girl today?
She passed away
What did her friend say?

They said she's too high
Too high
Can't hang around anyway

Billy Stewart,Strange Feeling,Blues,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love",179

Gil Scott-Heron,Home Is Where the Hatred Is,Blues,"A junkie walking through the twilight
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it,
might not be such a bad idea if i never, never went home again

stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
hang on to your rosary beads
close your eyes to watch me die
you keep saying, kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it
God, but did you ever try
to turn your sick soul inside out
so that the world, so that the world
can watch you die

home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
home is where the needle marks
try to heal my broken heart
and it might not be such a bad idea if I never, if I never went home again
home again
home again
home again
kick it, quit it
kick it, quit it
kick it, quit it
kick it, can't go home again",190

Sam Cooke,Tennessee Waltz,Blues,"I was dancing with my darlin’
to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one
and while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin’
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.

She comes dancing through the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I’m falling apart
And it’s stronger than drink
And it’s deeper than sorrow
This darkness she’s left in my heart.

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin’
The night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz.",135

Put yourself in Jesus' hands.""

And putting on a smile
But underneath theres another person
Who cant find a reason to make living worthwhile

Ah, another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and like having you
Ill never get used to

Ive gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now Im trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here !

Its like a childs first step
I have to learn to walk all, all over again
cause you were always there if I should fall
And now theres nobody else that I can call
Its like wanting you and not having you
Ill never get used to

Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand, huh!
To discover its my mind
Playing tricks on me again
Tricks on me again

Some things you never get used to
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end

Willie Dixon,I Can't Quit You Baby,Blues,"Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love

Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
And they'd rather give you a song then diamonds or gold
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's each night begins a new day
And if you don't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probly just ride away

Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love

Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain moringin's
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
And them that don't know him won't like him
And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong he's just different
but his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right

Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys

Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years.

My love blossmed tenderly,
My life grew sweeter through the years.

I know that my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
That's why we made it through the years.

I was made to love her,
Worship and adore her,

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end,
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!

My baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going nowhere.

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me,
I had the fever with each passing year.

Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,
If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there.

He told me, ""Darling, I love you"". Baby, baby, you lied
You, you lied you know that you lied, lied lied

Curtis Mayfield,"The Makings of You - Live @ Bitter End, NYC",Blues,"A little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
It is true, the makings of you, oh

It's been a miracle for what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one for the righteous way to go
Anyone would know
I believe I thought I told you so
You're second to none

Love of all mankind should reflect some sign
Of the words I'm trying to recite
They're close, but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Describing the makings of you",112

caught up in circles confusion--
is nothing new
Flashback--warm nights--
almost left behind
suitcases of memories,
time after--

sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
you're calling to me, I can't hear
what you've said--
Then you say--go slow--
I fall behind--
the second hand unwinds

chorus:
if you're lost you can look--and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
time after time

after my picture fades and darkness has
turned to gray
watching through windows--you're wondering
if I'm OK
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time--

chorus:
if you're lost...

you said go slow--
I fall behind
the second hand unwinds--

chorus:
if you're lost...

A tapestry to feel and see;
Impossible to hold.

Once amid the soft silver
Sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune;
A drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth
Around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors;
Yellow, green, on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty
As if he didn't know
Just what he was there for
Or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something
Golden hanging from a tree
And his hand came down emp-ty.

Soon within my tapestry,
Along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock
And turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen
Into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer,
Though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow,
There suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly
Beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness
I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling;
He's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.",203

Herbie Hancock,Watermelon Man - Remastered,Blues,"(instrumental)
Album notes:
Head Hunters is an album by Herbie Hancock, released in 1973 on Columbia Records. The album is a key release in Hancock's career, and also a defining moment in the genre of jazz fusion.

The album was released after Hancock's sextet had released a series of experimental albums (Mwandishi (1970), Crossing (1971), Sextant (1972)) and Hancock was looking for a new direction in which to take his music: ""I began to feel that I had been spending so much time exploring the upper atmosphere of music and the more ethereal kind of far-out spacey stuff. Now there was this need to take some more of the earth and to feel a little more tethered; a connection to the earth....I was beginning to feel that we (the sextet) were playing this heavy kind of music, and I was tired of everything being heavy. I wanted to play something lighter."" (Taken from Hancock's sleeve notes from the 1997 CD reissue)
For the new album, Hancock assembled a new band, The Headhunters, of whom only Bennie Maupin had been a sextet member. Hancock handled all synthesizer parts himself (having previously shared these duties with Patrick Gleeson) and he decided against the use of guitar altogether, favouring instead the clavinet, one of the defining sounds on the album. The new band featured a tight rhythm and blues-oriented rhythm section, and the album has a relaxed, funky groove that gave the album an appeal to a far wider audience. Perhaps the defining moment of the jazz-fusion movement, the album made jazz listeners out of rhythm and blues fans, and vice versa. There is far more more rhythmic, harmonic and melodic freedom on the album than would be found on a 'typical' funk track, and the track lengths (""Chameleon"" weighs in at 15:41, and the rest are all between 5 and 10 minutes) allow these freedoms to be explored and developed.
Of the four tracks on the album ""Watermelon Man"" was the only one not written for the album. A hit from Hancock's hard bop days, originally appearing on his first album Takin' Off, it was reworked by Hancock and Mason and has an instantly recognisable intro featuring Bill Summers blowing into a beer bottle. The track features heavy use of African percussion. ""Sly"" was dedicated to Sly Stone but is in no way derivative of Sly's work. ""Chameleon"""" (the opening track) is another track with an instantly recognisable intro, the very funky bassline being played on an ARP Odyssey synth. ""Vein Melter"" is a slow-burner, predominantly featuring Hancock and Maupin, with Hancock mostly playing Fender Rhodes electric piano, but occasionally bringing in some heavily effected synth parts.
At the time of its release it was the best-selling jazz album of all time, and it still sounds fresh and funky today. It has been an inspiration not only for jazz musicians, but also to funk, soul music, jazz funk and hip hop artists.",490

I've heard that story many times before
And every time I threw it out the door

Still they come up to me
With a different name but the same old face
I can see the connection
With another time and a different place
They ain't blonde-haired or blue-eyed
But they think that they're the master race
They're nothing but blind fascists
Brought up to hate and given lives to waste

They wanna waste my life
They wanna waste my time
They wanna waste my life

From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine.
But by day, I make the cars,
and by night, I make the bars,
If only they could read between the lines!

You know,
I rode a freight train north to Detroit City,
After all these years,
I find that I've just been wastin' my time.
So I think I'll take my foolish pride,

Goin' back to the love ones,
The ones I left waitin' so far behind.

There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today

For only love can conquer hate

Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, what's going on

But who are they to judge us
Simply 'cos our hair is long

She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions, spells and curses....

Down in Louisiana, where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone
She'd go (growl) another man done gone.

She lives in a swamp in a hollow log
With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
She's got a bent, bony body and stringy hair
If she ever seen y'all messin' 'round there
She'd go (growl) another man done gone.

And then one night when the moon was black
Into the swamp come handsome Jack
A no good man like you all know
(TALK) He was lookin' around for Marie Laveau.

He said Marie Laveau, you lovely witch
Gimme a little charm that'll make me rich
Gimme a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do
This very night, I'm gonna marry you
Then It'll be (growl) another man done gone.

So Marie done some magic, and she shook a little sand
Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled, and she said Hey, Hey
I'm gettin' ready for my weddin' day.

But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumblin', her fangs started gnashin'
Her body started tremblin', and her eyes started flashin'
And she went (growl) another man done gone.

So if you ever git down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife

I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.",311
Johnny Cash,Country Boy,Country,"Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to ma and me,
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze.

Now I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid,
But the meanest thing that he ever did,
Was before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke,
An' it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks,
Seems I had to fight my whole life through.

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red,
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame.

But I made me a vow to the moon and stars,
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars,
And kill that man that gave me that awful name.

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July,
and i'd just hit town and my throat was dry,
thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.

In and old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table dealin' stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad,
from a worn out picture that my mother had,
and I knew that scar on his cheek & his evil eye.

He was big and bent and grey and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said,
""My name is Sue! how do you do! Now you gonna die!""
Yeah that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes,
And he went down but to my surprise,
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece o' my ear.

I busted a chair right across his teeth,
And we crashed through the wall and into the street,
Kickin' and a gougin' in the the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men,
but I really can't remember when,
he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.

Well I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough,
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough,
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along.

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye,
I knew you'd have to get tough or die,
And it's that name that helped to make you strong.

Now you just fought one hell of a fight,
And I know you hate me and ya got the right,
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do.

But you oughtta thank me before I die,
For the gravel in your gut and the spit in your eye,
'Cause I'm the son of a bitch that named you Sue.""

yeah, what could I do, what COULD I do?
Well I got choked up and threw down my gun,
Called him my pa and he called me his son,
And I come away with a different point of view.

I think about him now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,
And if I ever have a son,
I think I'm gonna name him,
Bill or George anything but Sue!
I still hate that name!",607
Alan Jackson,Pop a Top,Country,"Pop a top again
I just got time for one more round
Sit em up my friends
Then I'll be gone
Then you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you'd to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streamming down his face.

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Sit em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.

Home for me is misery and here I am wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me it's not what I perfer
So it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her.

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Sit em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

Johnny Cash,The Legend of John Henry's Hammer,Country,"John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the serrif comes i wanna tell you, listen boy,
said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to

John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
the babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he siad i'll pay you quarter at a time, sartin tommorow, thats the pay for a steel driver on this line

Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, i see you brought you own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
and he said, I can turn a jack, i can lay a track, i can pick a shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
i can i'll do anything oyu hire me to

now aint you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer

he said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, i'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do

With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a fay for driven steel,
(sewat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel

Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring,

but the bad boss come up laguhing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gona get a steam drill to do your share of driven, then whats all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you

John Henry said i feed four little brothers, and baby sisters walking on her knees, did the lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and whats a subsitute for bread and beans, i saint seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam

John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill

John Henry said to his captain, a man aint nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, i'll beat it fair and honest, i'll die with my hammer in my hand, but i'll be laughing, cuz you cant replace a steel driven man

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, i suppose you didnt hear me, i said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin to you

2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountains caving in, John Henry told the captain, thell the kind fols not to worry, that aint nothin but my hammer suckin wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle i intend,

Captain tell the people move back further, i'm at the finish line and i aint no drill, shes so far behind you aint got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, lord lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills

Well John Henry had a little woman, i believe the lady's name was polly ann, yeah that was his good woman, john henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here polly ann come here sugar, ya know i believe this is the first time i ever watched the sun come up that i couldnt come up

Take my hammer polly ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'l all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them thats not all i can do, tell em i can hoist a jack, and i can lay a track, i can pick and shovel too, aint no machine can, thats been proved to you

There was a big crowd of moarners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails john henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh lord, down there lies a steel driven man",923

Johnny Cash,"Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart - Live at Folsom State Prison, Folsom, CA - January 1968",Country,"I hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....",176

Where do we take it from here
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
We've been the same way for years
We need to change

Somebody told me when I got to Nashville
Son you finally got it made
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
I don't think Hank done it this way

Ten years down the road, making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time just so I understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way
Did Ol' Hank really do it this way?

I've seen the world with a five piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way
No I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way

I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin'
that I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darling, when's she coming home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin'
sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow if I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know I'll keep on loving you

Johnny Cash,The Old Account,Country,"I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sittin' there.
I said, ""Your old court house is kinda run down,
He said, ""Naw, it'll do for our little town"".
I said, ""Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit,
And that's a ragged old flag you got hangin' on it"".
He said, ""Have a seat"", and I sat down,
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town""
I said, ""I think it is""
He said ""I don't like to brag, but we're kinda proud of
That Ragged Old Flag

""You see, we got a little hole in that flag there,
When Washington took it across the Delaware.
and It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it,
writing ""Say Can You See""
It got a bad rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
tugging at its seams.
and It almost fell at the Alamo
beside the Texas flag,
But she waved on though.
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville,
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill.
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg,
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag

""On Flanders Field in World War I,
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun,
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two,
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
by her Uncle Sam.
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
and now they've about quit wavin' back here at home
in her own good land here She's been abused,
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused,
And the government for which she stands
Has scandalized throughout out the land.
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearin' thin,
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in.
Cause she's been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more.

""So we raise her up every morning
And we take her down every night,
We don't let her touch the ground,
And we fold her up right.
On second thought
I *do* like to brag
Cause I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag""",380

Where's this place called &amp;quot;Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?&amp;quot;

I'm looking for that lonely street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called &amp;quot;Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?&amp;quot;

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called &amp;quot;Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?&amp;quot;

Perhaps upon that lonely street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love di-ie

If I could find that lonely street
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet
Where's this place called &amp;quot;Lonely Stree-ee-ee-eet?&amp;quot;

There's no need to pretend
Set me free - darling rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needing you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please- darlin rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see- darling rescue me",148
Lefty Frizzell,Long Black Veil,Country,"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity nears
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows but me",174
Chris Stapleton,Broken Halos,Country,"Just another day without you.

I'll be fine.
I'll be alright.

I'll find some one new without you.
Somebody just like you but not you.
I'll be alright.
Say I'll be alright.

But I'm breaking apart inside.
I'm breaking apart inside.
I cry in my sleep at night.
I'm breaking apart without you.

I hardly ever think about you.
I said I'd call but I don't need to.
I'll be fine.

I've got so much to do without you.
I said that I'd be lost without you.
I'll be fine.
Just give me time.

Cause I'm breaking apart inside.

I cry in my sleep at night.
I'm breaking apart without you.

And I'm hoping, you're doing fine too

I don't wanna sleep without you.
Dreams don't mean a thing without you.
I feel so alone without you.

"Hank Williams, Jr.",All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,Country,"All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And ol' George Jones I'm glad to see is finally gettin' straight
And Waylon's stayin' home and lovin' Jessi more these days

And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And cornbread and ice tea's took the place of pills and ninety proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah and I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68

Lefty Frizzell,"Saginaw, Michigan",Country,"I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My dad was a poor, hard-working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay

I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me ""that son of a Saginaw fisherman""
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand

Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool, I'm a-diggin' in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich, and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said, honey I'm a-coming home, please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history

Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, ""son, you wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim""

Now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw, Michigan
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw, Michigan",242
Rainbow,Since You Been Gone,Country,"[INTRO]

Whhooaa, whhooaa, whhooaaaa

I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast a spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you been gone

So in the night I stand beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast a spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you been gone

[INTERLUDE]

If you will come back
Baby you know
You'll never do wrong

Huhhhhh

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast a spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh

I surrender to your heart babe
Do anything that you want me to do
Please be tender I'm in your hands girl
This is a feeling I never knew
You know I tried to make it on my own
That's not the way it was meant to be
Spend my time waiting by the phone
Oh darling come back to me

I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender
Oh be tender, girl be tender
Can't you feel the love that I send you
I surrender.

I remember, seems like a lifetime
Can't believe it's a matter of days
Since you left me I'm near to heartbreak
I want you so bad don't turn away
What does it take to stay by my side
You know I'll do what you want me to
Don't take away this feeling inside
I'm still in love with you

I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender

Luke Bryan,I Don't Want This Night To End,Country,"I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night",172
Chet Atkins & His Colorado Mountain Boys,Dizzy Strings - Buddha Remastered - 2000,Country,"the first thing that happened was the river overflowed
the water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
i knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream

and then love pulled out the heavy artillery
kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
i count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count so high
when love cuts the strings

i smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
you poked your head out of an alley half a block away
and i recognized you, though i'm not sure how
and the air turned red around you
as a dull chill came down over me

and then love summoned up the infantry
and the green-eyed goddess got ready for all out war
and i'd count my blessings,
but i don't even know what the word blessing means
when love cuts the strings
yeah!",165

""She's My Kind Of Rain""

She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

She sits quietly there
Like water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain",201

White Line Fever
a sickness born down deep within my soul

The wrinkles in my forehead show the miles I've put behind me
They continue to remind how fast I'm growin' old
Guess I'll die with this fever in my soul

At a point we'll both decide to meet at the same time tonight

If my feet could fit a railroad track I guess I'd been a train

Back in 1947 that's when more than times were hard
Well pity me I didn't find the line in time like a fool
In front of God and everybody I politely blew my cool
Ain't no God in Mexico ain't no comfort in the kin

If you will just replace the missing part
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did

The bargain store is open, come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the mechandise
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied

Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love, but I still have some more

but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay

"Hank Williams, Jr.",Country State Of Mind,Country,"The preacher man says it’s the end of time
And the Mississippi River she’s a goin’ dry
The interest is up and the Stock Markets down
And you only get mugged
If you go down town

I live back in the woods, you see
A woman and the kids, and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain’t too many things these ole boys can’t do
We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

Because you can’t starve us out
And you cant makes us run
Cause one-of- ‘em old boys raisin ole shotgun
And we say grace and we say Ma’am
And if you ain’t into that we don’t give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the and the western skies
And we can skin a buck; we can run a trot line
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I’d send him some homemade wine

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars my friend lost his life
Id love to spit some beechnut in that dudes eyes
And shoot him with my old 45
Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

Cause you can’t starve us out and you can’t make us run
Cause one-of- ‘em old boys raisin ole shotgun
And we say grace and we say Ma’am
And if you ain’t into that we don’t give a damn

We’re from North California and south Alabam
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck; we can run a trot line
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive",380
"Hank Williams, Jr.",Family Tradition,Country,"Country music singers
Have always been a real close family,
But lately some of my kinfolks
Have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because
I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition

They get on me and want to know Hank
Why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over
Everybody makes my prediction
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on
An old family tradition

I am very proud
Of my daddy's name
All though his kind of music
And mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over
Put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition

Don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk
And some ole slick's trying to give me friction
I'll say leave me alone
I'm singing all night long
It's a family tradition

Lord I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973.
When that doctor asked me,
Son how did you get in this condition?
I said, hey sawbones,
I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition

So don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Stop and think it over,
Try and put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, its a family tradition!",284
Luke Bryan,That's My Kind Of Night,Country,"I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night",172
Lonestar,I'm Already There,Country,"He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
She said Daddy when you coming home?
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said, I really miss you darlin'
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be all right
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh I'm already there

We may be a
Thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you
Wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that we share?

I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you

I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right

David Allan Coe,You Never Even Called Me By My Name,Country,"It was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
Even though your on my fightin' side.

CHORUS
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain.
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
I've seen it on signs where I've laid
But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.

CHORUS...

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
and he told me it was the perfect country and western song.
I wrote him back a letter and told him it was NOT the perfect
country and western song because he hadn't said anything about
Momma, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk.

Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent
it to me and after reading it, I realized that my friend had written
the perfect country and western song. And I felt obliged to include it
on this album.

The last verse goes like this here:

Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
And I went to pick her up in the rain.
But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train.

CHORUS
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain. No,
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name.",342

Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home
If I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home

If life's darkest hours father when my troubles come
Keep my feet from wandering there from Thee I'll roam
Lest I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home

Johnny Cash,Tennessee Flat Top Box,Country,"In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: &amp;quot;Don't stop.&amp;quot;
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)",199

If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado

You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado

A least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, listen close so you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Since love ain't here I don't feel a thing
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank

Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain.

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In the land that knows no parting

Willie Nelson,Stay All Night (Stay a Little Longer),Country,"I used to play around with hearts
that hastened at my call,
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

She played around and teased me
with her carefree devil eyes,
She'd hold me close and kiss me
but her heart was full of lies.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

She told me how she cared for me
and that we'd never part,
And so for the very first time
I gave away my heart.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

The next day she was gone
and I knew she'd lied to me,
She left me with a broken heart
and won her victory.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..

I'd played this game with other hearts
but I never thought I'd see,
The day that someone else would play
love's foolish game with me.

Poor little fool, oh yeah,
I was a fool, uh huh..",179

Tim McGraw,Something Like That,Country,"It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair,
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white t-shirt
You were killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbeque stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss

I said a heart don't forget something like that

Mark Wills,Don't Laugh At Me,Country,"Laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared

Well, the holes in the walls
Were such a lot
Welcome to London town
But when you’re new to it all
And you think you’re hot
You’re not planning on hanging around
People would go on their different ways
I left to start a band
A note came through the letter box
In your childlike hand

Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared

One day I rode to where you were
The doorbell jangled a note
They buzzed me in
I climbed the stairs
In my boots and leather coat
There’s an old brass
Standing there at the top
Without her witch’s broom
It almost seemed like a knocking shop
When the girls came out of their rooms

And they all stood around
And stared at me
Two brunettes and a blonde
Then the old brass shrugged and said
We don’t know where she’s gone
Later on I picked up the ball
And I took off down the line
I suppose by then I’d realised
You’d run into hard times

Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared

Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the tennessee hills and it better be soon

We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And take off to calhoun country and catch us a coon

But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye
Man,we lit up your world like the 4th of July

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass it's the American way

We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress that had a split from the side clean
up to my hip
It was red velvet trimmin' and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
as she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run'd off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
&amp;quot;To thine own self be true&amp;quot;
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you

She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down now your Mama's gonna move you uptown.

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't long 'til I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
In an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hippocrits
That would call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For high on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down, hon
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown

Oh, and I guess she did.",627

We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recongnize
When we see Old Glory flying there's alot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the Army when he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye
Man,we lit up your world like the 4th of July

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass it's the American way

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist

are watchin snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
Theres joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is

Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonley just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle bear(?)
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

Johnny Cash,"Green, Green Grass of Home - Live at Folsom State Prison, Folsom, CA - January 1968",Country,"I hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....",176

"Hank Williams, Jr.",Family Tradition,Country,"Country music singers
Have always been a real close family,
But lately some of my kinfolks
Have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because
I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition

They get on me and want to know Hank
Why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over
Everybody makes my prediction
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on
An old family tradition

I am very proud
Of my daddy's name
All though his kind of music
And mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over
Put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition

Don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk
And some ole slick's trying to give me friction
I'll say leave me alone
I'm singing all night long
It's a family tradition

Lord I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973.
When that doctor asked me,
Son how did you get in this condition?
I said, hey sawbones,
I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition

So don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?

Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Stop and think it over,
Try and put yourself in my unique position

There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you (How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung 'round her by the score
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)

She was tops in all they said

She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen (Not a care, this teenage queen)

But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen you should be a movie queen)

He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen see you on the movie screen)

Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store

Willie Nelson,City of New Orleans,Country,"Ridin' on the City of New Orleans Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and graveyards full of old black men
And graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you? Say, don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with an old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels a rumbling neath the floor
And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good morning America...
[ guitar ]
Night time on the City of New Orleans changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues
Good morning America...",255

Somehow knew he was born to play

Cause there's no future on the road your takin'
But he never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
Late at night you could hear him say

I'm gonna be somebody,
one of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody, someday,

took him ten years to the top
and now he's number one on the stage and the radio
still he can't believe how people come from miles around
when it seems like only yesterday
when he would say

when He heard a voice in the front row singin
It was a sandy-haired River boy with same ole hungry eyes

I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound

Play me some songs about a ramblin' man, put a cold one in my hand,
'cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' cause I'll get all balled up
inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Sure enough about closing time, (I'm) about stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky-tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun come, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound

Play me some songs about a ramblin' man, put old Jim Beam in my hand
'cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't you play 'Your Cheatin' Heart' cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Johnny Cash,Don't Take Your Guns to Town,Country,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",305

Tim McGraw,Red Ragtop,Country,"I was twenty and she was eighteen,
We were just about as wild as we were green,
In the ways of the world.
Well she picked me up in that red rag top,
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops,
On a summer night, running all the red lights.

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal burning stove.
We were cooking with gas
knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be, for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school,
And life was fast and the world was cruel,
We were young and wild, we decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets in the morning light,
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end,
No I can't say where she is today,
I can't remember who I was back then.

Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins,
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time, drive you outta� your mind.

Beside a young girl in a cabriolet and her eyes were green,
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped

Merle Haggard,I Think I'll Just Stay Here And Drink,Country,"Could be holding you tonight
Could quit doing wrong,start right
You don't care about what I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
A least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, listen close so you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, hurtin' me know don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here I don't feel a thing
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
I think I'll just stay here and drink",121
Johnny Cash,Don't Take Your Guns To Town,Country,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",305

In this one horse town.
Over yonder, coming up the road
In a beat-up Chevy truck

Splashing through the mud and the muck

Parked in the very last row
They're too busy holding on to one another
To even care about the show
But later on outside the Tastee Freeze,
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says, ""my high school ring will have to do
Till I can buy a wedding band""

When they come sneaking up the walk
He says, ""young lady get on up to your room
While me and junior have a talk""
But Mama breaks in and says, ""don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
When you yourself was just a hay-seed plowboy
Who didn't have a row to hoe""

When it came to brains, you had the short end of the stick
But he was wrong and honey you are too

Separated from the rest
Fights problems with bigger problems

Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
Water pouring from her eyes

You'd be a work of art

The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Still prepared for an attack

Felt a wave a rush of blood

And you're out swimming in the flood
You kept back you kept unspoken

When you're saying goodbye
Like you wanna say hi

Revolver's been turned over
And now it's ready once again
The radio was playing ""crimson and clover""

London bridge is safe and sound
No matter what you keep repeating
Nothing's gonna drag me down
To a death that's not worth cheating

Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over

Bring the wheels of time to a stop

Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely
How I realise they were the best years of my life

I wish that I could turn back the clock

A case of giving up
No

Gone away...

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world...
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.
What is happening to me?

Where is my friend when I need you most?

Somehow I have to find.

Here today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

Dream suspicious strangers over night.

Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness.

Briding a widow in spite of her venom,
I've failed to mention your soul,
Three becoming two.

Such a left in criminal,
Only the mind of the temptress knows,
Actions are my remorse for amnesia.

Even choose a side.

I took the old track
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
On the tall cliffs

The jaded underworld was riding high
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
And as the nail sunk in the cloud, the rain
Was warm and soaked the crowd.

Lord, here comes the flood
Here we'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent
In any still alive
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry.

You have no home, you have no walls
In the thunder crash
You're a thousand minds, within a flash
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see
The actors gone, there's only you and me
If we break before the dawn
They'll use up what we used to be.

Queen,Radio Ga Ga,Electronic,"Radio I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And ev'rything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
Radio

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio someone still loves you

We watch the shows - we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Can't eat can't sleep

With a kiss you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa...

weak when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes...
I get weak when you're next to me
weak from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes...
I...get weak...

Romantic eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist their power
You know you've got a hold of me
You know you've got me where i want to be..

Like a wave you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this, i dont know
I just know that there's no way to fight it..

But I'm dancing on the valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the dangerline
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it

And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre

I'm on a ride and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and the TV set
Don't want to be around when this gets out

Too feeble to let go.

Should have stopped this long ago.

Go now, you've been set free.
Another month or so you'll be gorging on me (&amp;quot;poisoning me&amp;quot; on 2nd and 3rd times)
With your lovely smile.
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail,
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile.

Had you coiled around my arm.
How could you ever know
How I loved your diamond eyes?
But that was long ago. (Chorus)

And I should have believed Eve.
She said we had to blow.
She was the apple of my eye.
It wasn't long ago. (Chorus)",117

Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh ev'ry night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays

Toe your line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall

It's gonna fall
Hammer
You know
Hammer to fall
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time",235

Twisting the bones until they snap
I scream but no one knows
You say I'm familiar cold to touch
And then you turn and go

Feels like heaven...

See how we planned for saddened eyes
And tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew
My hair returned to grey
Study your face and fade the frame
Too close for comfort now
We can recall the harmony
That lingered but turned sour

Married with a lack of vision

Sade,War of the Hearts,Electronic,"You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind

Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

Shall I stay here at the Zoo
Or shall I go and change my point of view

David Pabon,Aquél Viejo Motel,Electronic,"For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you

I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you",181

Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
Radio

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

We watch the shows - we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

I bet you like it
French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me
With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream
The best things are the wet dreams
And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Or lee, I speak the truth
'cause the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
'cause, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'
Southern boys we crave for old slice of pie after they main course
So if you game for it
I came for it
I got a thing for ya
That I can't ignore

Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum
Goodie goodie gum drop
Put me in a tongue lock
Did it till my body went numb, numb
Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weed
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my style was just right
'cause she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night
So put the bubbles in the tub and Ludacris and me

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeeeah Yeeeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

[Trick Daddy]
Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

What I found to be true

Watching your love action

Though I know that there's no Lord above

I should learn to be a man

Picture this, if I could make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall

And how can I try

To ease the pressure of
My ever worried mind

Sade,Frankie's First Affair,Electronic,"good times they come and they go
never going to know
what fate is going to blow
your way just hope that it feels right
sometimes it comes and it goes
you take it ever so slow
and then you lose it, then it flows right to you

so we rely on the past
special moments that last
were they as tender as we dare to remember
such a fine time as this
what could equal the bliss
the thrill of the first kiss
it'll blow right to you

it's never as good as the first time
never as good as the first time

good times they come and they go
never going to know
it's like the weather
one day chicken next day feathers
the rose we remember
the thorns we forget
we'd love and leave
we never spend a minute on regret

it is a possibility
the more we know the less we see
second time, second time is not quite what it seems
natural as the way we came to be
second time won't live up to the dream

it's never as good as the first time
never as good as the first time

natural as the way we came to be
second time won't live up to the dream
natural as the way we came to be
second time is not quite what it seemed

it's never

Gloria Gaynor,I Will Survive - Rerecorded,Electronic,"At first I was afraid,

kept thinking I could never live without you by my side,

I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
if I had known for just one second,
you'd be back to bother me.

walk out the door,
just turn around now,

you'd think I'd lay down and die!

I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
and I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself,
I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high,
and you see me,
somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
and so you felt like dropping in,
and just expect me to be free,
but now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,

You haven't got a hold at all
When you reach the top
Get ready to drop
Prepare yourself for the fall

Don't turn that way
Straight down the middle until next Thursday

Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracry ?
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues

And anything is possible when you're Sowing the Seeds of Love
Anything is possible - Sowing the Seeds of Love

I spy tears in thier eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste !
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician Grannie with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the Majority feels ?
So without love and a promise land
We're fools to the rules of a Goverment plan
Kick out the style ! Bring back the jam !

Anything...
Sowing the Seeds
The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me in love

Feel the pain
Talk about it
If you're a worried man - then shout about it
Open hearts - feel about it
Open minds - think about it
Everyone - read about it
Everyone - scream about it !
Everyone
Everyone - read about it, read about it
Read in the books in the crannies and the nooks there are books to read
Chorus !

(Mr. England Sowing the Seeds of Love)

Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes

High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
Every minute of every hour - "" I Love a Sunflower ""
And I believe in lovepower, Love power, LOVEPOWER !!!

Sowing the Seeds
An end to need
And the Politics of Greed

for sins and false alarms
so to america the brave
wise men save

near a tree by a river
there's a hole in the ground
where an old man of aran
goes around and around
and his mind is a beacon
in the veil of the night
for a strange kind of fashion
there's a wrong and a right
but he'll never, never fight over you

i got plans for us
nights in the scullery
and days instead of me
i only know what to discuss
of for anything but light
wise men fighting over you

it's not me you see
pieces of valentine
with just a song of mine
to keep from burning history
seasons of gasoline and gold
wise men fold

i got time to kill
sly looks in corridors
without a plan of yours
a blackbird sings on bluebird hill
thanks to the calling of the wild
wise mens child

Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when…

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh ev'ry night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays

Toe your line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall

It's gonna fall

I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
I woke from my dream and all idols was clay
And all portions of love then had all flown away

He told me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning, no words of farewell

Delta lady

Please don't ask how many times I found you
Standing wet and naked in the garden
And I think of days
And the different ways I held you
I held you closely to me, yes our heart was beating

Cos you're mine delta lady
Yeah you're mine, be all mine
Delta lady

Oh when I'm home again in england
And I'm thinking of you
Beause, I love you, yes I do

There are concrete mountains in the city
And pretty city women live inside them
And yet it seems the city scene is lacking
I'm so glad you're waiting for me in the country

For you're mine delta lady
Darlin' you're mine, be all mine
Delta lady

Gonna walk, gonna talk
Gonna scream and shout
Gonna tell all the world
What I'm thinkin' about",179
Judee Sill,Crayon Angels,Folk,"Crayon Angel songs are slightly out of tune
But I’m sure I’m not to blame.
Nothin’s happened but I think it will soon,
So I sit here waitin’ for God and a train,
To the Astral plane.

Magic rings I made have turned my finger green.
And my mystic roses died.
Guess reality is not as it seems,
So I sit here hopin’ for truth and a ride,
To the other side.

Phony prophets stole the only light I knew,
And the darkness softly screamed.
Holy visions disappeared from my view,
But the angels come back and laugh in my dreams,
I wonder what it means.",106
John Fahey,On The Sunny Side Of The Ocean,Folk,"It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon

Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay

Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon",116
The Kingston Trio,Three Jolly Coachmen,Folk,"Dave Guard

One, two, and three jolly coachmen sat at an English tavern. Three jolly coachmen sat at an English tavern,
And they decided, and they decided, and they decided to have another flagon.

Landlord, fill the flowing bowl until it doth run over. (Repeat)
For tonight we merr-I be, (Repeat twice)
Tomorrow we'll be sober. (What!)

Here's to the man who drinks dark ale and goes to bed quite mellow! (Repeat)
He lives as he ought to live (Repeat twice)
He'll die a jolly good fellow! (Ha! Ha! Ha!)

Here's to the man who drinks water pure and goes to bed quite sober. (Repeat)
He falls as the leaves do fall, (Repeat twice)
He'll die before October! (Ho! Ho! Ho!)

Here's to the maid who steals a kiss and runs to tell her mother. (Repeat)
She's a foolish, foolish thing. (Repeat twice)
For she'll not get another. (Pity!)

Here's to the maid who steals a kiss and stays to steal another. (Repeat)\
She's a boon to all man kind. (Repeat twice)

The Byrds,Wasn't Born to Follow,Folk,"Written by Carol King and Gerry Goffin

Oh I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescent's glowing and
Run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And Wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no-one knows the names of
And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside a legendary fountain
Till I see your form reflected
In it's clear and jeweled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our vision
Flow into one another
I will watch her dive beneath
The white cascading waters
She may beg she may plead
She may argue with her logic
And then mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
In the end she will surely know
I wasn't born to follow",145
Don McLean,And I Love You So,Folk,"And I love you so,
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now
I tell them ""I don't know""

I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening bring me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
This is my belief

And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And I love you so
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now
I tell them ""I don't know""",171
Iris DeMent,Our Town,Folk,"CHORUS: And ya know the sun's setin' fast
And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts
Go on now and kiss it goodbye
But hold on to your lover 'cause your heart's bound to die
Go on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town
Can't you see the sun's settin' down on our town, on our town
Goodnight

Up the street beside that red neon light
That's where I met my baby on one hot summer night
He was the tender and I ordered the beer
It's been forty years and I'm still sittin' here

CHORUS

It's here I had my babies and I had my first kiss
I've walked down Main Street in the cold morning mist
Over there is where I bought my first car
It turned over once but then it never went far

CHORUS

I've buried my Mama and I've buried my Pa
They sleep up the street beside that pretty brick wall
I bring 'em flowers about everyday
But I just gotta cry when I think what they'd say

CHORUS
If they could see how the sun's setting fast...

Now I sit on the porch and watch the lightnin' bugs fly
But I can't see too good, I got tears in my eyes
I'm leavin' tomorrow but I don't wanna go
I love you, my town, you'll always live in my soul

But I can see the sun's seting fast
And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts
Go on, I gotta kiss you goodbye
But I'll hold on to my lover 'cause my heart's 'bout to die
Go on now and say goodbye to my town, to my town
I can see the sun has gone down on my town, on my town

Graham Nash,Military Madness,Folk,"How can i bring you
To the sea of madness
I love you so much
It's gonna bring me sadness
I've never seen you
Through these eyes before
Now i don't believe it
I think i'll take it
Or leave it.

All i need
Is your sweet sweet loving
Fill my life with happiness
All i want is your heart
Every time i think of you
Mine falls apart.

I went to heaven
And i stood at the crossroads
I'll love you tomorrow
As sure as the wind blows

On the mountain clover
Washes away
Until the music is over.",102

Bobbie Gentry,Ode To Billie Joe,Folk,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",358

The Byrds,My Back Pages,Folk,"Crimson flames tied through my years
Flowing high and mighty trapped
Countless fire and flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
We'll meet on edges soon, said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate, I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
Sisters fled by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now",195
Joni Mitchell,Chelsea Morning,Folk,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the
traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells,
and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtain, and
a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome
you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay,
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a
portait of today
And the streets are paved with passerby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a
bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
and stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the
rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning",228

I know a thing or two I've learned from you

Lead Belly,In New Orleans,Folk,"One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite.

A man I know, went down to Louisiana,
had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna,
He kissed the whiskers, left & right
Whiskers!

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter, our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set the room alight.
Whiskers!

Down on Bourbon street, You know it's right
You can see my friend, they run around all through the night
Most everywhere, Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor, Doin' up my hair

New Orleans queens, Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite

I don't wanna make no late night New York calls
And I don't wanna stare at them ugly grass matte walls
Chronologically I know you're young
But when you kissed me in the club you bit my tongue
I'll write a song for you, I'll put it on my next L.P
Come up to my motel room, sleep with me !
There's a Bible in the drawer don't be afraid
I'll put up the sign to warn the cleanup maid
Yeah there's lots of soap end ther's lots of towels

He makes friends easy
He's not like me
I watch for judgement anxiously
Now where in the city
Can that boy be?
Waitin' for a car
Climbin'
Climbin'
Climbin' the hill

He's a real good talker
I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend

But there's still no buzzer
They roll on
And I'm waitin' for his car on the hill

You know he seemed so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter
When there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark

Climbin' the hill",165
The Dubliners,The Rocky Road to Dublin - Live,Folk,"In the merry month of May, From my home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam, Nearly broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, Kissed my darlin' mother,
Drank a pint of beer, My grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, And leave where I was born,
I cut a stout blackthorn, To banish ghost and goblin,
In a brand new pair of brogues, I rattled o'er the bogs,
And frightened all the dogs,On the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin,
Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.

In Mullingar that night, I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight, Next mornin' light and airy,
Took a drop of the pure, To keep my heart from sinkin',
That's an Irishman's cure, Whene'er he's on for drinking.
To see the lasses smile, Laughing all the while,
At my curious style, 'Twould set your heart a-bubblin'.
They ax'd if I was hired, The wages I required,
Till I was almost tired, Of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin,
Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity,
To be so soon deprived, A view of that fine city.
Then I took a stroll, All among the quality,
My bundle it was stole, In a neat locality;
Something crossed my mind, Then I looked behind;
No bundle could I find, Upon my stick a wobblin'.
Enquirin' for the rogue, They said my Connacht brogue,
Wasn't much in vogue, On the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin,
Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.

From there I got away, My spirits never failin'
Landed on the quay As the ship was sailin';
Captain at me roared, Said that no room had he,
When I jumped aboard, A cabin found for Paddy,
Down among the pigs I played some funny rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, The water round me bubblin',
When off Holyhead, I wished myself was dead,
Or better far instead, On the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin,
Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.

The boys of Liverpool, When we safely landed,
Called myself a fool; I could no longer stand it;
Blood began to boil, Temper I was losin',
Poor ould Erin's isle They began abusin',
""Hurrah my soul,"" sez I, My shillelagh I let fly;
Some Galway boys were by, Saw I was a hobble in,
Then with a loud hurray, They joined in the affray.
We quickly cleared the way, For the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three, four five,
Hunt the hare and turn her
Down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin,
Whack-fol-lol-de-ra.",492

Joni Mitchell,Willy,Folk,"Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again
Like I gave my heart too soon
He stood there looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why
I love him

Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know its hard to tell
When your in the spell if its wrong or if its real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared too feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are some many reasons why I love him",174
Tom Rush,Urge for Going - 2008 Remaster,Folk,"(Introduction, only on live album „An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer“, spoken:)
''I am reminded at this point of a fellow I used to know
whose name was Henry, only to give you an idea of what
a individualist he was, he spelled it H-E-N-3-R-Y –
the three was silent, you see.
Henry was financially independent, having inherited his
father's tar-and-feather business, and was therefore
able to devote his full time to such intellectual pursuits
as writing. I particularly remember a heartwarming novel
of his about a young necrophiliac who finally achieved his
boyhood ambition by becoming coroner... (The rest of you
can look it up when you get home.)
In addition to writing, he indulged in a good deal of
philosophizing. Like so many contemporary philosophers, he
especially enjoyed giving helpful advice to people who were
happier than he was. And one particular bit of advice which
I recall – which is the reason I bring up this whole dreary
story – is something he said once, before they took him away
to the „Massachusetts State Home for the Bewildered“.
He said: „Life is like a sewer – what you get out of it depends
on what you put into it.“ It's always seemed to me that this
is precisely the sort of dynamic, positive thinking that we so
desperately need today in these trying times of crisis and
universal brouhaha. And so with this in mind, I have here a
modern, positive, dynamic, uplifting song, in the tradition
of the great old revival hymns. This one might more accurately
be termed a survival hymn. It goes like this:''

When you attend a funeral,
It is sad to think that sooner o'
Later those you love will do the same for you.
And you may have thought it tragic,
Not to mention other adjec-
Tives, to think of all the weeping they will do.
(But don't you worry.)
No more ashes, no more sackcloth.
And an armband made of black cloth
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve.
For if the bomb that drops on you
Gets your friends and neighbors too,
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve.

And we will all go together when we go.
What a comforting fact that is to know.
Universal bereavement,
An inspiring achievement,
Yes, we all will go together when we go.

We will all go together when we go.
All suffuse with an incandescent glow.
No one will have the endurance
To collect on his insurance,
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go.

Oh we will all fry together when we fry.
We'll be french fried potatoes by and by.
There will be no more misery
When the world is our rotisserie,
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry.

Down by the old maelstrom,
There'll be a storm before the calm.

And we will all bake together when we bake.
There'll be nobody present at the wake.
With complete participation
In that grand incineration,
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak.

Oh we will all char together when we char.
And let there be no moaning of the bar.
Just sing out a Te Deum
When you see that I.C.B.M.,
And the party will be „come-as-you-are.“

Oh we will all burn together when we burn.
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn.
When it's time for the fallout
And Saint Peter calls us all out,
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn.

You will all go directly to your respective Valhallas.
Go directly, do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dolla's.

Burl Ives,Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,Folk,"You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice;
Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better not cry
Better not pout

Big Bill Broonzy,When I Been Drinking,Folk,"""You gonna sing me a song?""
""Ohhh oh ohh! Maybe you should sing a song.""

If I had a dollar bill for every
Time I've been wrong
I'd be a self-made millionaire
And you'd still be gone
So hand me down my best dress shoes
And my best dress shirt
'Cause I'm going out in style
To cover the hurt

All I wanna do all day
Is spend it in bed
But that's bad for the body
And even worse for my head
So I'll try and find a place where no one will
Ask me a thing
It'll help me to forget
And help me to sing

'Cause now, I'm drunk again
The means to my end
And I'm scared of myself
'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself again

Have you ever wanted to wake up
From your dreaming
It scared you so bad you couldn't control
Your heart or your breathing
Well, walk out the door with me on the floor
You don't care how I'm feeling
I guess a weak and tired and frightened man
Is no longer appealing

'Cause now, I'm drunk again
The means to my end
And I'm scared of myself

'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself again

Some people have a gift of reaching right
Into your soul
And finding the hole
And making it bigger
Baby, sometimes I think I catch you cracking
Cynical smiles
And in a short while
You'll be my heart's gravedigger
Well, there's not much I can do
'Cause I'm at mercy of you
So, baby, I guess we're through

'Cause now, I'm drunk again
The means to my end
And I'm scared of myself

'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself

'Cause now, it's all the same
The faces and names
And I'm scared of myself

So go, walk out the door
You don't believe me no more
And I'm scared of myself again

If I had a dollar bill for every
Time I've been wrong
I'd be a self-made millionaire
And I wouldn't be singing",365
"Peter, Paul and Mary",Lemon Tree,Folk,"When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me,
&amp;quot;Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Don't put your faith in love, my boy&amp;quot;, my father said to me,
&amp;quot;I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree.&amp;quot;

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky.
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
the music of her laughter hid my father's words from me:

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.

One day she left without a word. She took away the sun.
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done.
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true.
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you:

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
but the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat.",271

there's one way I can walk alone

Bruce Cockburn,Wondering Where The Lions Are,Folk,"Sun's up, uh huh, looks okay
The world survives into another day
And I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

I had another dream about lions at the door
They weren't half as frightening as they were before
But I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

Walls windows trees, waves coming through
You be in me and I'll be in you
Together in eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

Up among the firs where it smells so sweet
Or down in the valley where the river used to be
I got my mind on eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...


Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake
Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take
Pointing a finger at eternity
I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy

Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun,
Polished as precise like the brain behind the gun
(Should be!) they got me thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...


Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay
One of these days we're going to sail away,
going to sail into eternity
some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me


And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...",253

Eyes of flashin' blue

Won't buy you dreams for you

Cut yourself a columbine
Tear it from the stem
Now breathe upon the petals fine
And throw them to the wind

Watch the petals dancin'
See them twirl and sing
All your pride and prancin'
How much does it mean?



Watch the petals start to fly
And then come falling down
Hear the wind begin to cry
As she sees some touch the ground

Ah, lady, like the flower fair
Some day you'll have to fall
And you can find me standin' there
To catch you if you crawl

Tossin' hair a-ravin'

Won't buy you dreams for you",131

But I'm gettin' off where the crossroads meet.

It's a quarter moon in a ten cent town
It's time for me to lay my heartaches down
Saturday night I'm gonna make myself a name
Take a month of Sundays to try and explain.

It's gonna be easy to fill the heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high
In a fandangled sky.

It's gonna be easy, it's gonna be easy
It's gonna be easy from now on.

Raw as a whip but clean as a bone
Soft to the touch when you take me home
When the morning comes and it's time for me to leave

Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man

Think I might've been gone, I've been gone too long

I can hardly sing my song
Hustlers stand around me,
I'm lost and all alone
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm lost ins the woods, I'm lost in the woods
Big city gamblers, gamblers take my money
Yes it gets to be useless, yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost, when I'm lost inside this jungle
Can't see the forest for the tress
Well pretty little woman come and get me
Try me, try me one more time
Yes and your sweet, your sweet understanding
Cant' fix this broken heart of mine
The vultures fly around, come and take me home

My buddies tell me that I should've waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise

My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun

Emmylou Harris,To Daddy - 2003 Remaster,Folk,"(Dolly Parton)

Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

The only thing that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

He often left her all alone but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she don't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it our ears could not believe it
The words she had written there to daddy.

She said the kids are older now they don't need me very much
And I've gone in search of love I need so badly
I have needed you so long without you things can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home.

But she did, she never did say so to daddy

and set up my still
if whiskey don't kill me
Lord, I don't know what will

and I go to some barroom
to drink with my friends
where the women they can't follow
to see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
with breath as sweet as
the dew on the vine

let me eat when I'm hungry
let me drink when I'm dry
two dollars when I'm hard up
religion when I die
the whole world is a bottle
and life is but a dram
when the bottle gets empty
Lord, it sure ain't worth a damn",128
Townes Van Zandt,Lungs - Live,Folk,"By townes van zandt

Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing.
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
Pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision.

Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool, it's only moonlight.
If you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another.



Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at it's mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers

Jesus was an only son
And love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one, and you for two
Ai'nt got the time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you
We'll tell the world we tried",178

Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light

I don't care what's right or wrong, I don't try to understand.
Let the devil take tomorrow. Lord, tonight I need a friend.

Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight.
And it's sad to be alone. Help me make it through the night.

Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Such spirit through the year

Emmylou Harris,Two More Bottles of Wine - 2003 Remaster,Folk,"(Delbert McClinton)

We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had migtha set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
My baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down


Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Lord I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine",152
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,You Ain't Going Nowhere,Folk,"The Devil went down to Georgia
He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
Cause he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot
And the Devil jumped up
On a hickory stump and said
Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said, my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
Cause I'm the best there's ever been

Johnny, rosin up your bow
And play your fiddle hard
Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia
And the Devil deals the cards

And if you win
You'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose
The Devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case
And he said, I'll start this show
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

And he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished, Johnny said
Well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done

Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The Devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite
No, child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, Devil, just come on back
If you ever wanna try again
I done told you once, you son of a bitch
I'm the best there's ever been

He played Fire on the Mountain
Run, boys, run
Devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, will your dog bite
No, child, no",388

Spends the whole day saying I beg your pardon

This is the house that Jack built baby
And it reaches up into the sky

Uncle Joe cracks walnuts inbetween his toes for fun
And looks through coloured glass at the dark spots on the sun

Joni Mitchell,Conversation,Folk,"He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafes
And I only say, hello
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring
To wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second hand
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they're found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrow endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her?

He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find",179

Velvet curtains on the windows to
Keep the bright and unforgiving
Light from shining through

Baby, I remember all the things we did
When we slept together
In the blue behind your eyelids
Baby, sweet baby

Traced your scent through the gloom
'Til I found these purple flowers
I was spent, I was soon smelling you for hours

Lavender, lotus blossoms too
Water the dirt, flowers last for you
Baby, sweet baby

Tangerines and persimmons
And sugarcane
Grapes and honeydew melon
Enough fit for a queen

Lemon trees don't make a sound
'Til branches bend and fruit falls to the ground
Baby, sweet baby

Come to my wolrd and witness
The way things have changed
'Cause I finally did it, baby
I got out of La Grange

Got in my Mercury and drove out west
Pedal to the metal and my luck to the test
Baby, sweet baby

I been tryin' to enjoy all the fruits of my labor
I been cryin' for you boy but truth is my savior

Baby, sweet baby if it's all the same
Take the glory any day over the fame

Joni Mitchell,Down to You,Folk,"everything comes and goes
marked by lovers and styles of clothes
things that you held high and told yourself were true
all start changing as the days come down to you

down to you, constant stranger
you're a kind person you're a cold person too
its down to you

you go down to the pickup station craving warmth and beauty
you settle for less than fascination,
a few drinks later you're not so choosy
and the closing lights strip off the shadows on this strange new flesh you found
clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
you hurry
to the blackness
and the blankets
to lay down
an impression
and you're lonely

in the morning there are lovers in the street
they look so high
you brush against a stranger and you both apologize
old friends seem indifferent, you must have brought that on
old bonds are broken down
love is gone

ooh, love is gone
written on your spirit the sad song
love is gone

everything comes and goes
pleasure moves on too early and
trouble leaves too slow
just when you're thinking you've finally got it made
bad news comes knocking at your garden gate
knocking for you, constant stranger
you're a brute, you're an angel
you can crawl, you can fly too
it's down to you
it all comes down to you",227

Now you've decided to show me the same

Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

My eyes just about popped out of my head
It said &amp;quot;the stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed&amp;quot;

I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way
Mmmmm, I feel lucky today

Well I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying, &amp;quot;girl, you better get back home&amp;quot;

But I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away
Mmmmm, I feel lucky today

Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
I'd bought the house a double, and the waitress a new car
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner, trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
Hey the stars might lie, but the numbers never do

I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight

I feel lucky, brrrrr, I feel lucky, yeah
Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
Mmmmmm, I feel lucky today",288

Saw a sign on the highway
I was driving along, way home
On a hilltop is where I belong
I took a look at the hole
Where my head used to be
And I'll sing you a song
That descended on me

The way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
Yes the way I live
Determines the way
My people survive

So I went to the country
To look up a friend
Cause I heard that the house
And the barn had a blend
I took a look at the hole
Where the bird used to be
And I'll sing him a song
Because he sang one for me

The way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
Yes the way I live
Determines the way
My people survive

And the names of the cowboys
Will all blow away
Like the dust off the desert
On a hot windy day
I've tried so hard to tell you
In so many ways
That I'm scared of the heartache and scenes
With the cowboy of dreams

strange moon
strange land
strange man

hold your hands, your tiny horses
hold them hold them kindly

low, red moon
how can you sleep like a baby?
sleep like a baby?

when you shine so different on another,
you shine different on another

i look up and i see the raising of an old hope
brave and tatterred
a shining night with shining eyes he shines around me brightly

so, now, i say this beautiful
i think you are strange

low, red moon
how can you sleep like a baby?
sleep like a baby?
when you shine so different on another
you shine different on another

strong arms for a skinny girl

Joni Mitchell,Cactus Tree,Folk,"There's a man whose been out sailing,
in a decade full of dreams.
And he takes her to a schooner,
and he treats her like a queen.
Bearing beads from California,
with their amber stones and green.
He has called her from the harbor,
he has kissed her with his freedom,
he has heard her off to starboard
in the breaking and the breathing of the water weeds.

While she was busy being free.

There's a man who's climbed a mountain,
and he's calling out her name,
and he hopes her heart can hear,
3,000 miles he calls again,
he can think her there beside him,
he can miss her just the same.
He has missed her in the forest,
while he showed her all the flowers,
and the branches sang the chorus,
as he climbed the scaly towers of a forest tree.

While she was somewhere being free.

There's a man who sent a letter and he's waiting for her reply.
He has asked her of her travels since the day they said goodbye.
He writes, ""Wish you were beside me, we could make it if we try.""
He has seen her at the office, with her name on all his papers,
through the sharing of the profits,
he will find it hard to shake her from these memories.

And she's so busy being free.

There's a lady, in the city, and she thinks she loves them all.
There's the one who's thinking of her,
There's the one who sometimes calls.
There's the one who writes her letters,
with his facts and figures scrawl.
She has brought them to her senses,
they have laughed inside her laughter.
Now she rallies her defenses,
for she fears that one will ask her for eternity.

And she's so busy being free.

There's a man who sends her medals,
he is bleeding from the war.
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store.
There's a drummer, and a dreamer,
and you know there may be more .
She will love them when she sees them,
they will lose her if they follow.
And she only means to please them,
and her heart is full and hollow like a cactus tree.

While she's so busy being free.

Like a cactus tree-
Being free.",384
Joan Baez,Silver Dagger,Folk,"(traditional)

Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here right by my side
And in her right hand a silver dagger,
She says that I can't be your bride.

All men are false, says my mother,
They'll tell you wicked, lovin' lies.
The very next evening, they'll court another,
Leave you alone to pine and sigh.

My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long,
And on every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged.

Go court another tender maiden,
And hope that she will be your wife,
For I've been warned, and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life.",114
Lead Belly,I'm All Out And Down (156-B),Folk,"Down by the seaside. See the boats go sailin'
Can the people hear, What the little fish are sayin'

Oh, oh, the people turned away. Oh, the people turned away

Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racin', racin'
No time left, to pass the time of day

The people turned away. The people turned away
So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run, see how they run, see how they run.

Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I wanna tell you... Some go twistin' every day
though sometimes it's awful hard to tell

Out in the country, hear the people singin'
Singin' 'bout their progress, knowin' where they're goin'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, the people turned away
Yes, the people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine, pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature. And she will come back again
The people turned away
The people turned away",171
Kris Kristofferson,Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,Folk,"Well I woke up sunday morning
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast
Wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
It's the one I'm wearin'
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
Or I smoked so much the night before
With cigarettes and songs that I've been pickin'
My mouth was like an ashtray I'd been lickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kicking
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way

Chorus:
On the sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing lord that I was stoned
'cause there is something in a sunday


That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city side walks
Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and
Somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday.

Chorus:
On the sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing lord that I was stoned
'cause there is something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city side walks
Sunday mornin' comin' down.",303

Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey,
But it's really not my home.
My fingernails are filthy.
I've got beach tar on my feet.
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne.

Oh, Carey get out your cane, and I'll put on some silver.
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you.

Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe and I will buy you a bottle of wine.
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing, and smash our empty glasses down.
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers,
A round for these friends of mine.
Let's have another round for the bright red devil, who keeps me in this tourist town.

Oh, Carey get out your cane, and I'll put on some silver.
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you.
I like you, I like you, I like you.

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam, or maybe I'll go to Rome.
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers round my room,
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now, the night is a starry dome.
And they're playing that scratchy rock 'n' roll beneath the Matalla moon.

Oh, Carey get out your cane, and I'll put on some silver.
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you.

The wind is in from Africa.

Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, but it's really not my home.
Maybe it's been too long a time since I was scrambling down in the streets.
Now they got me used to that clean white linen and that fancy French cologne.

They reach for her but she's not there

Goodbye baby. We'll meet again soon maybe....
But until we do, all my best to you
I'm so lonely, I think about her only

I go to places we used to go
But I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside

Joan Baez,Henry Martin,Folk,"There were three brothers in merry Scotland,
In merry Scotland there were three,
And they did cast lots which of them should go,
should go, should go,
And turn robber all on the salt sea.

The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin,
The youngest of all the three;
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea,
Salt sea, salt sea.
For to maintain his two brothers and he.

He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day,
Before he espied a stout lofty ship,
lofty ship, lofty ship,
Come abibing down on him straight way.

Hullo! Hullo! cried Henry Martin,
What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London town,
London Town, London Town
Would you please for to let me pass by?

Oh no! Oh no! cried Henry Martin,
That thing it never could be,
For I am turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, salt sea.
For to maintain my two brothers and me.

Come lower your topsail and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee,
Or I will give you a full canon ball,
canon ball, canon ball,
And your dear bodies drown in the salt sea.

Oh no! we won't lower our lofty topsail,
Nor bring our ship under your lee,
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods,
merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea.

Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three,
Till Henry Martin gave to her the deathshot,
the deathshot, the deathshot,
And straight to the bottom went she.

Bad news, bad news, to old England came,
Bad news to fair London Town,
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away,
cast away, cast away,
And all of her merry men drown'd.",319

Don McLean,American Pie,Folk,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So... bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a Rollin' Stone
But that's not how it used to be
When The Jester sang for The King and Queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
In a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while The King was looking down
The Jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fall out shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With The Jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While The Sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candle stick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singin'...

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin'... this'll be the day that I die",877
Noel Paul Stookey,Wedding Song (There Is Love),Folk,"Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees

Love is in the air

In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

CHORUS

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh oh oh

Love is in the air
In the rising of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe inr

And it's there when I look in your eyes

Joni Mitchell,"Intro To The Circle Game - Live at The 2nd Fret, Philadelphia, PA, 11/1966",Folk,"Yesterday, a child came out to wander
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful, when the sky was full of thunder
and tearful at the falling of a star

and the season's they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go round and round and round in the circle game

then the child moved ten times round the seasons
skated over ten clear frozen streams
words like ""when you're older"" must appease him
and promises of ""someday"" make up his dreams

and the seasons, they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go round and round and round in the circle game

sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
cartwheels turn to carwheels through the town
and they tell him, ""take your time, it won't be long now
'til you drag your feet to slow the circle's down""

and the seasons, they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return, we can only look
behind from where we came
and go round and round and round in the circle game

so the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
though his dreams have lost some gandeur coming true
they'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams, and plenty
before the last revolving year is through

and the seasons, they go round and round
and the painted ponies go up and down
we're captive on the carousel of time
we can't return we can only look
behind from where we came
and go round and round and round in the circle game

and go round and round and round in the circle game",327
Gordon Lightfoot,The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,Folk,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
Then later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
When the wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezing rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck
Sayin' ""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven p.m. a main hatchway caved in
He said, ""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went out of sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does anyone know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below, Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early",459
Townes Van Zandt,Be Here to Love Me,Folk,"Whoa, here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey, I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much

And I can't recall
Any love at all
Ah baby, this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

I tell myself
Hey, only fools rush in
And only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line

Hey!
No, I can't recall
Anything at all
Oh, baby this blows them all away
Woo!

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
You want it straight from the heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

Woo!
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart

John Hiatt,Memphis In The Meantime,Folk,"I got something to say little girl
You might not like my style
But we've been hanging around this town
Just a little too long a while

You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I don't get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten

Chorus:
Lets go to memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol country boots
For some fine italian shoes

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We don't need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat

Until hell freezes over


Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think ronnie milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

Chorus twice

Bridge:
Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the rendez-vous

'cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone

But...

Wilco,Heavy Metal Drummer,Folk,"I sincerely miss
Those heavy metal bands
I used to go see
On the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love

Shiny shiny pants
Bleached blonde hair
A double kick drum
By the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another
Then another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers
Beautiful and stoned

Unlock my body
Move myself to dance
Into warm liquid
Flowing blowing glass
Classical music blasting
Masks the ringing in my ears

Oh I sincerely miss
Those heavy metal bands
I used to go to see
On the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love

I miss the innocence I've known
Playing Kiss covers
Beautiful and stoned",149
The Kingston Trio,M.T.A.,Folk,"Jacqueline Steiner/Bess Hawes

Spoken:
These are the times that try men's souls. In the course of our nation's history, the people of Boston have rallied
bravely whenever the rights of men have been threatened. Today, a new crisis has arisen. The Metropolitan
Transit Authority, better known as the M. T. A., is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population in the
form of a subway fare increase. Citizens, hear me out! This could happen to you!

(Eight bar guitar, banjo introduction)

Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charley on a tragic and fateful day.
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family, went to ride on the M. T. A.
Chorus:
Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown. (What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere.)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned.

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square Station and he changed for Jamaica Plain.
When he got there the conductor told him, &amp;quot;One more nickel.&amp;quot; Charlie couldn't get off of that train.

(Chorus)

Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station, crying, &amp;quot;What will become of me?!!
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea or my cousin in Rocksbury?&amp;quot;

(Chorus)

Charlie's wife goes down to the Sculley Square Station every day at quarter past two,
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin' through.

(Chorus)

Now, you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal how the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase! Vote for George O'Brien! Get poor Charlie off the M. T. A.

(Chorus)

He's the man who never returned. He's the man who never returned. Ain't you Charlie?",319
Lead Belly,"Haul Away, Joe",Folk,"Hey lady
You got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darlin', darlin', darlin'
Walk a while with me
Ohh, you've got so much
So much
So much

Many have I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've lied
And many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Really ought to know, ohh ohh
I really ought to know",135
Casting Crowns,Praise You In This Storm,Hip Hop,"I was sure by now,
God You would have reached down
and wiped our tears away,
stepped in and saved the day.
But once again, I say amen
and it's still raining.
As the thunder rolls
I barely hear You whisper through the rain,
'I'm with you'
and as Your mercy falls,
I raise my hands and praise
the God who gives and takes away.

Chorus:
And I'll praise you in this storm
and I will lift my hands
for You are who You are,
no matter where I am
and every tear I've cried
You hold in your hand.
You never left my side
and though my heart is torn,
I will praise You in this storm.

I remember when I stumbled in the wind,
You heard my cry to You
and raised me up again.
My strength is almost gone -
how can I carry on,
if I can't find You?
And as the thunder rolls
I barely hear You whisper through the rain
'I'm with you'
and as Your mercy falls,
I raise my hands and praise
the God who gives and takes away.

Chorus

I lift my eyes unto the hills
where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord,
the maker of heaven and earth.
I lift my eyes unto the hills
where does my help come from?
My help comes from the Lord,
the maker of heaven and earth.

Kanye West,Champion,Hip Hop,"''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
That's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit
My daddy say ""when you see clothes close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he sent me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey!

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
That's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

When it feel like livin's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

''Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns!
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number 1?
Tell me what it takes to be number 1?
This is the story of a champion

I'm sittin on the couch and wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple broke out the titty
Squezed her nipple said suck it if you like but please don't bite it
I had an urge to say fuck it but I knew I had to fight it

Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin in a purple samuri suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal

Dude she was dope man real dope on the wheel
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey a beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach
Tuesday me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin on the beach and now she's rubbin on my booty
Suck suck suckin on my neck like dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (why?)
Cuz everytime I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like quit b
Bitch was frontin but I didn't say nothin
Then all of the sudden after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me oh please god no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a john doe
He pulled a fast one on me yo

Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You alright?
Aw, nigga what the fuck is wrong wit you?)

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of them (naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand (nigga, talk to me please)
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sista had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak.
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin',
matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'.

Don't drink while I sing, keyed up in shelter

Chaos, no mass confusion, EpMD's in town
Total chaos, no mass confusion
Bronx'll hit the dot, EpMD's in town. Don't - EpMD's in town
Don't drink while I sing, keyed up in shelter
Don't sleep on it either, You see something might rupture
It don't take time for me to blow your mind
It take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge. 'Cause you're a MC clown
Or join the circus. EpMD's in town

Total chaos, no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizing known to cause an illusion
Like a magician who draws a rabbit out a hat, son
I'm drawin' more, like a 44-Magnum
MC's please stop, look, and listen and try to imagine
It's travellin' the speed of light
But everything' motion it's frightening
Plus the thought of you alone
You now enter the dimension called the Twilight Zone
You're terrified, plus you can't bear the thought
You and I one-on-one in the land of the lost
You start to shiver, then you scream, my friend
You wake up, Muttley, because you're dreamin' again
Next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth suckered up, because I'm Strictly Business

You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby,

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing.
Fierce nipple pierce...
You got me sprung with your tongue ring,
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high.
So, to keep you by my side,
There's nothing that I won't try.
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill...
Time is passing. I'm asking, ""Could this be real,""
'Cause I can't sleep. I can't hold still.
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal I can feel.
Too much is never enough.
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough.
I was lost. Now I'm found.
Ever since you've been around...
You're the women that I want,
So, yo, I'm putting it down.

Come, my lady.

Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious.
Then I guess it's true.
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you.
See, I was lost and confused,
Twisted and used up.
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it.
My lifestyle's wild.
I was living like a wild child,
Trapped on a short leash,
Parole. The police files...
So, yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd. So...

Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,

I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.

Hey, sugar momma, come and dance with me.
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me.
Whatever tickles your fancy...
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy.
So sexy, almost evil...
Talk about butterflies in my head.
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read,
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead.
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase,
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this.
So, butterfly, here is a song,
And it's sealed with a kiss and a ""thank you, miss.""

Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me.
So, come and dance with me.

How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all that glitters is not gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (all gold is not reality)
(real is what you live to be)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Pumpkin bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did the guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

[Hook: Choir]

And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]

This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, ""See, that's my cousin on TV""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
The second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

I hold the mic, like niggaz hold their girls tight
But I ain't after her, probably your Acura pearl white
The hooker? Nah, as many times as I done hit it?
To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the god in me, pardon you
Jeepers! I was torn back, the hoe gained access to my beeper
Call back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, &quot;Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain ... hoe!&quot;

Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's

Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific gone bezerk like Red Alert
I really wanted to pick up was [?] for cheddar dirt
The funniest experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible

Yo, that ain't right
Yo, well anyway

By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, gots many plus plenty
String by string, I think I counts like twenty
If you loan me a ear, I'll return it with interest
If not, I'll simply twist the wrist
So listen up closely, with thoughts to recoup me
Cause I hope to gross like ten cent per groupie
Now only if I had two G's per strand
Ask my anchor banker, he understands
I used to wrap my hand around a cold gold can
Someone once said health is wealth, so check self
I gots a perfect check-up, 'cept for a hiccup, roll with no stick-up
How can I keep the goya nectars on my shelf?
Oh boya how I searched for an employer
But before Zeale Huckleberry film was in Tom Sawyer
Now use your imagination, just a smidgen
If I was a bird I'd be a pigeon
Succumb one to crumbs and pizza crust, when every fella can
eat fresh fish and live fat like pelican
Then again, that's only if your capable for freckles
or blue eyes -- I settle for Heckle'n'Jeckle
while I chuckle at my man with the cellular phone
The only phone I own's a funky xylophone's tone
Ain't no joint in, annoyin high-pitched ringin
We do the tap twist and twitch bringin
through soul and this cordless thingamajig
Sure as Onyx's clippers etch a clue to your wig
We'll do the gig so make your mind ??
The pipe, the bowl or us fiddlers, don't riddle us
I'll even ride a bus to the coast if clear
For okay pay, I'll say ??
Now all this runnin round's kickin me right in the rear

String by string, I think I counts five pairs
That's a little, but still, can I get a thumbs up?
At least for the peachfuzz that sums up
a tidbit, yeah that's it, but who gives a sugar
honey iced tea besides me
For if, I ever riff, yet and still, ? windmills
So I take time just to kill
I say cute is for a bear, teddy bear like Teddy Ruxpin
Would I be handsome if I pimped in a tux then
smoked a cigar with some black chinese shoes then
picked up some friends in my Benz and start cruisin
Huh, that's a dream that I ain't even livin
If that makes a man, surely I'll recommend
I'll stay a toy boy eatin Butterfingers
With Knowledge of Self, and colorin books on my shelf
I wanna grow up, cause maybe if I did then
I wouldn't be treated like a Toys'R'Us kid when
they counts ten upon my chin
By the hairs of my peachfuzz, let's say each was
an inch, psych because I can't pull or pinch
It's a wrench, and I thought life would be a cinch
But anyway, anyhow, let's talk about someway somehow
that I can make my peachfuzz grow out
Really, do I need beard that grows with no pores
just to be respected and resemble Santa Claus?
Hear this clear, I'm a MAN I tell ya
No dreams or drugs like the slugs will I ever sell ya
A man I am, in the body of a youth
So don't play me like I'm Born Universe Truth Truth
So when I knock at your hearts, let me in

Mudvayne,Happy?,Hip Hop,"In this hole
That is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole
Thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel it in me
So overwhelmed
All this pressured center rising
My life overturned
What dare the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole
That is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole
So limiting
The sun has set; all darkens

Buried underneath
Hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Are you
HAPPY

Are you
HAPPY

Are you feeling happy?

In this hole
That is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release??
What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Peel me from the skin
(Peel me from the skin)
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone
(Tear me from the bone)
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy?
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy?
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?",285

Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls, huh... yeah

[Notorious B.I.G.]
My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
with the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
have his mother singing ""It's so hard...""
Yes Love, love your fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
and bruised up from the pistol whipping
welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant
I'm slamming niggaz like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
cause Mom Duke ain't giving me shit
so for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?
(*sample* ""But he's sticking you, and taking all of your money.."")

[Chorus 8X]
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot
(*scratching* ""I'm a bad, bad, boy.."")

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
and I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace sending Mom Duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
cause when I lick shots the shits is persistent
Huh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip
One in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
before you find out how blue steel feel
from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get *strangled* for they earrings and bangles
and when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant ""baka! baka! baka!""
So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
and if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it

Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the Isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the Beem, you grab the fucking C.R.E.A.M
and if he start to scream ""bam! bam!"", have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar
Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot
(Oh shit! The cops!) Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
(So why the fuck he keep lookin?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot",791
2Pac,So Many Tears,Hip Hop,"I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...

Back in Elementry, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside mind couldn't find a place ta rest
Untill I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can ya feel me ?
I'm not liven in tha Past, You wanna last
Be tha first ta blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deseased
Call on tha sirens, I seem him murdered in tha streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a 'G' ?
Remember me, so many homies in the cemetary
Shed so many tears

[Chorus]

Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears

Now that i'm strugglin' in this business
By any means, label me greedy gettin green
But seldom seen
And fuck tha world cuz i'm cursed
I'm havin visions of leaven here in a hurse
God can ya feel me?
Take me away from all tha pressure and all tha pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is hell, where did I fail ?
My life is in denial
And when I Die, babtised in Eternal Fire
Shed so many tears...

[Chorus]

Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
Lord
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears

Now i'm lost and i'm weary
So many tears, i'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a compilated step
Ta bring me closer
To embrace an early death now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
Will I survive till' tha morning ta see tha sun
Please lord forgive me for my sins
Cause here I come...

[Chorus]

Lord
I suffer through tha years
And shed so many tears
God
I lost so many peers and

Lord knows i've tried, been a witness ta homicide
Drive-bys taken lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
This ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me
I'm stuck in tha game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately
I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady
Cause she's a product of this poison, i'm hearen noises
Think she's fucken on my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to tha floor
Beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in Heavens door
I shed so many tears...

Lord
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
I suffered through tha years and shed so many tears",578

A lot of people ask me.. stupid fuckin questions
A lot of people think that.. what I say on records
or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that..
I'm actually gonna do it
or that I believe in it
Well, shit.. if you believe that
then I'll kill you
You know why?
Cuz I'm a

CRIMINAL
CRIMINAL
You god damn right
I'm a CRIMINAL
Yeah, I'm a CRIMINAL

[Eminem]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's ""yes""
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin at my jeans, watchin my genitals bulgin (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin balls, you'd better let go of em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of em
Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin the mail
Get it? Checkin the 'male'? (clicks tongue twice)
How many records you expectin to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon!-- Relax Guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen (AAA-men!)
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin each March
With a brand new cd for these fuckin retards
Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. ""Don't Give A Fuck,"" still won't leave

Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)

I'm a CRIMINAL
Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a CRIMINAL
but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird
and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one

[Eminem]
My mother did drugs - hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a CRIMINAL - an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word...
My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happenin to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em
-inem and Kim combined - *kch* the maniac's in
Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin his place
(Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a CRIMINAL

Hurry the fuck up! {*BOOM*} Thank you!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Then fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets!
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask

Casting Crowns,Voice of Truth,Hip Hop,"Oh what I would do to have
The kind of faith it takes
To climb out of this boat I'm in
Onto the crashing waves

To step out of my comfort zone
Into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is
And He's holding out His hand

But the waves are calling out my name
And they laugh at me
Reminding me of all the times
I've tried before and failed
The waves they keep on telling me
Time and time again. ""Boy, you'll never win!""
""You'll never win!""

Chorus:
But the voice of truth tells me a different story
The voice of truth says, ""Do not be afraid!""
The voice of truth says, ""This is for My glory""
Out of all the voices calling out to me
I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth

Oh what I would do to have
The kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant
With just a sling and a stone
Surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors
Shaking in their armor
Wishing they'd have had the strength to stand

But the giant's calling out my name
And he laughs at me
Reminding me of all the times
I've tried before and failed
The giant keeps on telling me
Time and time again. ""Boy you'll never win!""
""You'll never win!""

But the stone was just the right size
To put the giant on the ground
And the waves they don't seem so high
From on top of them lookin' down
I will soar with the wings of eagles
When I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus
Singing over me

I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth",286

Intro: repeat 2X ('Biggie' repeats every line of beat)

This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you

Verse One:

Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like ramadan
Its that rap phenomenon Don-Dadda, fuck Poppa
You got ta, call me, Francis M.H. White
in tank-light totes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, and keep firin
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip, on that cat with that grip on rap
The mo shady, ""Tell em!"", Frankie baby
Ain't no tellin where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecomin
with my man Capone, dumbin, fuckin somethin
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
to orgies with hoes I never seen befo'
so, Jesus, get off the Notorious
penis, before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get, who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure
Biggie, ""How are you gonna do it?""

Chorus: repeat 4X

Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more

Verse Two:

On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get, when ya marked with death
Should I start your breath should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically, I'm worser, don't front the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them, cause they, nothin but dicks
Tryin to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds, that's sick
Got pay off my flow, rhyme with my own click
Take trips to Cairo, layin with yo bitch
I know you prayin you was rich, fuckin prick
When I see ya I'ma

Chorus

Verse Three:

This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of NY
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya Braille in it, stash that light shit, or scalin it
Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, vigilante
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other king in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren
One shot, they disappearin
Its ill when, MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home, Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragilly, my nine milly
make the white shake, thats why my money never funny
And you still recoupin, stupid *echoes*",841
The Notorious B.I.G.,One More Chance / Stay with Me - Remix; 2007 Remaster,Hip Hop,"All the rain came down
On a cold new town
As he carried you away
From your father's hand
That always seemed like a fist
Reaching out to make you pay

He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Oh Lord where did the feeling go
Oh Lord I never felt so low

Oh Lord I never felt so low",176

Oh I can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go
Each time I hear you say

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
The rhythm of the night

This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

Won't you teach me how to love and learn
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me you'll burn
And let me hold your hand

I don't wanna face the world in tears
Please think again I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me
No reason to repent
I know you wanna say it

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah

Chris Brown,Yo (Excuse Me Miss),Hip Hop,"I've been missing you

I've got the roses and I've got the wine
With a little luck she will be here on time
This is the place we used to go
With romantic music and the lights down low
And as you stand there amazed at the door
And you're wondering what all this is for
It's just a simple thing from me to you
The lady that I adore
Cause there's something that you should know

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow
And I said ""Now that I've found you
I'm never letting go""

There is no reason to the things that we do
You can break a heart with just a word or two
And take a lifetime to apologise
When the one you love's in front of your eyes
And I will fall to my knees like a fool
If it's the only way of getting through
You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is gonna feel it too
So there's only on thing to do

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it everyday
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow
Because now I've found you
I'm never letting... go.",233

Eminem,Space Bound,Hip Hop,"[Verse 1]
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn’t much
But it’s enough to make me wonder what’s in store for us
It’s lust, it’s torturous, you must be a sorceress, cuz you just
Did the impossible; gained my trust, don’t play games it’ll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, cuz if I get burnt
Ima show you what it’s like to hurt
Cuz I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards I’ll show ya (evil)
Nobody knows me, I’m cold, walk down this road all alone
It’s no one’s fault but my own. it’s the path I’ve chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don’t ask me why I have no love for these mo’fuckin’ hoes
Blood suckin’ succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I’ve tried in this department but I ain’t have no luck with this
It sucks, but it’s exactly what I thought it would be like tryna start over
I got a hole in my heart, some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won’t go till you toy with my emotions so it’s over
It’s like an explosion, everytime I hold ya I wasn’t joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you’re a supernova, and Imma…

[Chorus]
I’m a space bound rocketship and your hearts the moon
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

[Verse 2]
I’ll do whatever it takes, when I’m with you I get the shakes
My body aches, when I ain’t with you I have zero strength
There’s no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one, then once we get them it’s never the same
You want them when they don’t want you, Soon as they do feelings change
It’s not a contest and I ain’t on no conquest for no mate
I wasn’t looking when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let’s cut to the chase, before the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won’t be makin’ a mistake
Cuz Imma…

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So after a year and six months, it’s no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I’m bleedin, I’m tryna stop you from leavin’
You won’t even listen so fuck it, I’m tryna stop you from breathin’
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeazin’
Til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain’t no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks now I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple I told you this… (Gunshot)

And I woulda did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it’s over now, it’s too late to save our love
Just promise me you’ll think of me everytime you look up in the sky and see a star cuz Imma…

[Chorus 2]
I’m a space bound rocketship and your hearts the moon
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I’m so lost without you, without you, without you",653

Went to Carvel to get a milk shake
This honey ripped me off for all my loot cakes
The car oh yeah there's money in my jacket
Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo tip I tell you man the devil's tryin it
But I'm goin to stay strong cause I ain't buyin it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit I'm fryin it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool I'm gettin it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin it
Here we go with the cryin, yo he's throwin fits
My blood pressure's blowin up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car they almost killed me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo Sheila's home
Steady smilin like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down to hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Verse Two: Phife Dawg

Just last week my girl was stressin me
Now her best friend be underssin me
Well I was lovin her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walkin towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breakin niggaz on the inseams
Some niggaz cross town was tryin to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we look cute
Even if you give me boots, you'll neva see my loot
She wasn't even all of that just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chucky Booker
Sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin place
Just move from in front me with your botty face!

I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo

But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it
but, never Will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boone
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door

Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shank, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin
But I don’t like drama so I say to myself,
&quot;Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses&quot;
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin
Didn't get his wish,now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin red eyes, everything else is black

When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's goin down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge, With the buck shots, faggot
You've been lucky all day thats when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, go into you and your mother
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, Why ask why when you know
Nigga when its your time to go, roll

Mac Miller,Small Worlds,Hip Hop,"Written by Peter Green.


Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls

I guess I've got everything I need
I would't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

break:

And I need a good woman
to make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could

I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love",126
2Pac,Brenda's Got A Baby,Hip Hop,"Brenda's got a Baby
Brenda's got a Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
The girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms
and her dad was a junky
Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly's gettin bigger
But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, whos sexin her crazy
And yet through all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together,
whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
what ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, and social workers here
everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell

Eminem,Soldier,Hip Hop,"[Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now the Ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Shug
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runion Avenue Soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers",880

Wasn't it in a New England coast
Wasn't it the standard- people praying to
The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost

One nation over God

The founding fathers left a noble legacy
To their sons and daughters
Look at what we've done
Look at what we've done

Chorus:
Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown
As we learn to bite the hand
That tries to feed us
Breakdown, Breakdown, Breakdown
If we say that we are free
Who will believe us?
If we breakdown

See the powder on the glass
See the pillow on the street
See the charter of a modern love
With no obligations or promises to meet

Hear the fear of disease
Hear the baby never born
Hear a people crying out

From what we're headed for- From what

Verse 1: Raekwon The Chef
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive on second hands
Moms bounced on old men
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin wit this one
And that one, pullin out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin woolies at 16
And running up and gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys on ball courts
My life got no betta, same damn 'lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
SO I GOT WIT A SICK ASS CLIQUE AND WENT ALL OUT!
Catchin keys from across seas
Rollin in MVP's, every week we made 40 g's
Yo nigga respect time, or anger the tech-9
Ch-chick-POW, move from the gate now

Verse 2: Inspectah Deck
It's been 22 long, hard years of still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not... could not...
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin -- going up state's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase, sellin base
Smokin bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Skee-Lo,I Wish,Hip Hop,"Hey, this is radio station W-S-K-E-E
We're takin' calls on the wish line
Making all your wacky wishes come true

Hello

1-I wish I was little bit taller,
I wish I was a baller,
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a 64' Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go, and even in my dreams
I can scheme a way to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle
And I been in the hospital
For talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame when you livin' in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together
Right?
So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type
(rpt 1, 1)

I wish I had a brand-new car
So far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat
But that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really whack
See I can't even get a date
So, what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really tho' I 'm a figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
Cause it's hard to survive when your livin'
In a concrete jungle and
These girls just keep passin' me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Makes me say my, my, my
(rpt 1, 1)

I wish I was a little bit taller...
I wish I was a baller...
I wish I was a little bit taller y'all
I wish I was a baller (3)

Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause everyday would be a Friday
You could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names
Little Mookie, big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should notice how I feel
Cause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go greyhound
Hey, you , what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ahhhh, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like dat

Stretched across my shame

Leaped through and covered me

Just to have her for myself

Don't know what to do

The unattainable

Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel

Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away
I'll find myself today

Eminem,Sing For The Moment,Hip Hop,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing,
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out,
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back,
And broke his nose his house is a broken home,
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go...

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,
I guess words are a mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have,
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously,
so i'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal,
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to,
you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you...

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,
And then we get our checks in the mail - It's fucked up ain't it?
How we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it,
Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on,
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

[CHORUS X2]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today

Verse 1:
Your bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form flow, almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is back!
Looks like Batman, brought his own Robin
Oh god, Sadams got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums syringes
VRRM VRRM Here, here I come
Im inches away from you, dear fear none
Hip hop is in a state of nine-one one, so..

Chorus x2:
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town let's shut that shit down
On these clowns, can I getta witness? Hell Yeah!

Verse 2:
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to your lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it, but still everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and
exagerate it all So much
they make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rapping and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and André's carnival
C'mon, now!

Chorus x2

Verse 3:
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's is fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, played career russian roulette
And never even seen me blink, or get to busting a sweat
People stepping over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothing but clowns down here
But we, ain't fucking around round here
Yo Dre! .. what up? Can i get a hell? HELL YEAH!

You focus on the past your ass'll be a has but
Thats one to live by or either that one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andre, got to her station heres my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group aint commin wit it
But im witcha you cause you problay goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin, but examine all the flawsky-wasky
Awfully sad and its costly but thats all shit
BROKE. And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shits creek its week is the last quote
That I want to hear when Im goin down when all's said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record playa get skippin and slowin down
All yawl can say is them niggas earned that crown, but until then..

Linkin Park,By Myself,Hip Hop,"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust none and live life in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself, myself
I ask why but in my mind, I find
I can't rely on myself, myself
I ask why but in my mind, I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me until everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself, myself
I ask why but in my mind, I find
I can't rely on myself, myself
I ask why but in my mind, I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do?
When all I know is what you tell me to

Don't you know?
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you know?
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in",478
Dru Down,Pimp Of The Year,Hip Hop,"Where you when I said,""You remind me of a portrait in a dream""?
So I'll say, ""Cry, but your watercolors fade
This ain't science baby, it's called creativity""
If I move my hands right
If I move my hands right would you see yourself disappear?
I wash my filthy hands off
As your watercolors stain my fingers red and black
So, take my brushes off your portrait of a face
'Cause I will paint your smile into obscurity
Fill lips with black lines
Darken your smile
Layer paint upon paint until the words dry dead
Deep in your mouth, a desert's dry air
Layer pain upon paint like you were never there
Would you see yourself disappear
Like you were never there?",122
Three 6 Mafia,Late Nite Tip,Hip Hop,"Click your heals
And feel you come for me
Care free she's got something big to tell me
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
There's no simple way
To let you know
Funny how she always cried out daddy
I got a big surprise she said
I'm in trouble now
And it cannot wait
She's ten days late
Boy your life got complicated
Well I can't wait
To see this through
She's ten days late
Ten days late
Low ride bicycles go cruising by
I laugh
I don't even know why
Talk back at the ocean
Consequence and ozone
Catch a glow
Oh no baby oh no no
Give me a minute now
To figure out my state
Oh I know
She's ten days late
And I don't know


Where to take it
But it's still great
Knowing you
She's ten days late
Ten days late
Choir time has come for you to choose
Baby daddies keep your boo
Many blessings come to you
Baby daddy keep your boo end choir
Your eyes look to me for what to do
I can't lie
I don't know
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
No one's laughing
Now what do I say
I walk away but oh no
Don't go
At the ocean
Talk back at the ocean
Give me a minute now
To figure out my state
She's ten days late
And I'm never going to fade it
I guess I'll always be
Knowing you
Knowing you
Knowing you",252

I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend

it's such a shame our friendship had to end

purple rain, purple rain
purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

it's time we all reach out for something new, that means you too

I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain, once or twice but who's countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aww [shit], I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids (ahh!)
This room make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb [shit] start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
{*GUNFIRE*} I said come on, bounce (ahh!)
Everybody in the house doin mass amounts (me!)
To the women in the thongs with they asses out (oh)
We don't bull[shit], better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is crashin out
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out
Come on!

[Kon Artis and Kuniva]

Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of [cum]
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new [shit] (eww!)

Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was +Incredible+ and killed the +Hulk+
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes fall back and I'm scared for days
And when I'm, over weight and my golf ball broke
No okey-doke, I'm packin my nose with soap
{*cough cough cough*} Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by [whore] lady
Now I'm payin child support.. (it's your baby!)

I take fo' shots at one time
And I don't need a chaser when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any room?) In Bizarre's hatchback?
We can't go far cause our car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it soon
(Swift, chill) I'm just tryin to get bi like you! (eww!)
And I don't give a damn if they find me rude (uh-huh)
Mean, crude, the hell with you too (uh-huh)

I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

I'm at a rave lookin at a babe like she want it (hahaha)
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Loony, crazy, chunky, sexy, dopey-headed guy
Whip cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try? (c'mon)
Blue hills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill

Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo

On my never endin quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, cuz we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and blue but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that(OK)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm buggin out, so let me get back cuz I'm wettin niggaz

Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never comin less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back , relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's the dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can the steps
I roll with Shaheed and the brotha Abstract
Niggaz know the time when the Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi
The wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft

A Tribe Called Quest,I Left My Wallet in El Segundo,Hip Hop,"My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high
I pulled over to ask were we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto""
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor
Ali said, ""Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?""

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like)

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said, ""Pay for lunch""
So I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed:
""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
What do you know, my wallet I forget

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound
Jettin' on down at the seepd of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow""
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack
Of Shaheed, ""We gotta go back"" when he said
""Why?"" I said, ""We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""

Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get, I got-got ta get it",520

Don't turn your back on me baby.

Yes, don't turn your back on me baby

Don't turn your back on me baby

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*
i think my dad gone crazy!

Verse #1:
There's no mountain i can't climb, there's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound* Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it Marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound* Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
*Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby

Haley:
My dad's lost it

Chorus:
Eminem:
There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it

Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
Theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Verse 2:
It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine
n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch,
eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick
a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
in my nose then quit bringin' my flos,
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why i'm so
mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad!

Chorus

Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme - so what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter-
pret it at first, cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
before i'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums,
get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as bump n' grind comes on
More pain inside o' my brain,
than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather its Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jumpstart my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husbands heart problem is complicated
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie!""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?
Well I'm back fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gus-ting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

Another MC lose his life tonight Lord,
I banged out you brain to Jesus Christ
Why?
Oh Lord, Father don't let him BURY me, whoa
I horn MC's like mephistophales bringin' SWORDS OF DAMOCILES
Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract rap simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by paralac
Check out the retro great motion killed the notion
of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for your bitin' zealots, your rap's a cacophonic
If a prick predict but deep inside you wish you had a pop hit
It hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf,
To take over the earth...

(Lauryn)
See my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try to take lines and buy grines
We'll show how the refugees do,

Behold it's my own manifold on your rhymes
Two MC's can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the law of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics rap rejects
My tape deck ejects projectile
Whether Jew or Gentile I rentile percentile
Many styles more powerful than gamma rays
My grandma pays like Carlos Santana plays
Black Magic Woman
So while you fumin' I'm consumin' mango juice under pularis
You just embarrassed cuz it's your last tango IN PARIS
And even after all my logic and my theory,
I ADD a muthafucker so you ignorant niggas hear me
And remember take notes, cuz I SOE MY RAP OATS
For all you bitin' zealots, here's a quote

Aye another MC lose his life tonight, oh
I banged out you brain to Jesus Christ, why,
Oh Lord, Father don't let him bury we, aye.

You can try but you can't divide the tribe,
These cats can't rap mister author i feel no vibe
The magazine said THE GIRL shoulda went solo,
The guy should stop rappin', vanish LIKE MENUDO
Took it to the heart but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listenin' i knew it was a start
for me to get a chance grab my pen and revamp
Do a CAMEO while everyone do the dance (do the dance)
Quit now cuz you're runnin' out of luck-a
Playin' mister big I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munchin' at your luncheon I'll be plannin'
your assassination and hit you like the dutchman..

I compress sound sets my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my four five six amtax
Bring terror to the shop of horrors
As she cry mi amour the Phantom dies in the opera
And to the youngin's who carry gadgets,
and kill six days a week and rest on the Sabbath
(hold up hold up) violence ain't necessary
Unless you provoke me then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you bitin' zealots, your rap stars are relics
No matter who you damage, you still a forced PROFIT.

Linkin Park,Lying from You,Hip Hop,"When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just because I know I can
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from you

No, no turning back now
I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
No, no turning back now
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
No, no turning back now
Anywhere on my own because I can see
No, no turning back now
The very worst part of you is me

I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
And now you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away
Because I'm lying my way from you

No, no turning back now
I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
No, no turning back now
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
No, no turning back now
Anywhere on my own because I can see
No, no turning back now
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this

No, no turning back now
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone

Here's a little somethin' bout a nigga like me

With a right left, right left you're toothless
And then you say goddamn they ruthless!
Everwhere we go they say [damn!]
N W A's fuckin' up tha program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeah!
To drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mutha fuckin role model?
To a kid lookin' up ta me
Life ain't nothin but bitches and money.
Cause I'm tha type o' nigga that's built ta last
If ya fuck wit me I'll put a foot in ya ass
See I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin

Chorus:

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
&amp;quot;It's not about a salary, it's all about reality&amp;quot; - KRS One
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin
&amp;quot;Hopin you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say&amp;quot;

Verse Two: Ice Cube

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggaz start breakin out
Cause you know, they know whassup
So we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin
&amp;quot;I got a boyfriend&amp;quot; Bitch stop lyin
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nuttin but a dyke
Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like
Walked over to em, and said, &amp;quot;Whassup?&amp;quot;
The first nigga that I saw, hit em in the jaw
Ren started stompin em, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said, &amp;quot;Let's start some shit!&amp;quot;
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin niggaz out with a flurry of buckshots
Boom boom boom, yeah I was gunnin
And then you look, all you see is niggaz runnin
and fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin
and cussin, I stepped back, and I kept bustin
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A. is wanted for a homicide
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

Chorus:

&amp;quot;He'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a fuckin thing back&amp;quot;

Verse Three: Ice Cube

Homies all standin around, just hangin
Some dope-dealin, some gang-bangin
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared, and hit the gas
Right then, I knew I has to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play, from the ladies
With six niggaz in a car are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin
We all said &amp;quot;Fuck you bitch!&amp;quot; and kept goin
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nuttin at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still I won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you Fuck wit me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, cause I keep bailin
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?

Interlude: Ice Cube, Dr. Dre

[Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit]
{Man whatcha gonna do now?}
&amp;quot;What we're gonna do right here is go way back&amp;quot;
[How far you goin back?]
&amp;quot;Way back&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;As we go a lil somethin like this&amp;quot; - Slick Rick

Here's a lil gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy E cold runnin shit

Verse Four: Eazy E, MC Ren

Well I'm Eazy E the one they're talkin about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
Wit the &amp;quot;Diamond in the back, sun-roof top&amp;quot;
Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin to you
&amp;quot;We want to fuck you Eazy!&amp;quot; I want to fuck you too
Cause you see, I don't really take no shit

Far away, from each other”

Prince,Let's Go Crazy,Hip Hop,"''Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called LIFE.
Electric word ""life""
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, there's something else
The afterworld.
A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night.
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor''

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She just picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Aah, aah!"" is all I heard

I'm not gonna let de-elevator bring us down, oh no, let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go

All excited, but don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause, we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for)
Better live now
Before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
Tell me baby,
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go

Come on baby, let's get nuts!
Yeah, crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Go Crazy
I said, let's go (crazy)

Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming

&amp;lt;straight into verse one&amp;gt;

Verse 1:

He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's home and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goals to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it
and with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate
Now it's different he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comming up but it still hurt
And cain't nobody change this
It's ninteen-ninety-foe and we up against the same shit
*chorus* I nevah understand why
I could nevah seen a man cry, til i seen that man die
Verse two:

Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for service then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longeer will it be til it's all done?
Total darkness and ease be in all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take
You'll be heade to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
*chorus*

Verse 3:

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it but you'll still try
And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die
Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigormortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light,
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice let it go but u can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace

I still got to wondah why,
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die

Ha hah
You know the deal
It's just me, dog
Beats by Suprimo for all of my people, negroes and latinos
and even gringos...

Yo, check it one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth comin live, future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
with the probable tenth, the universe expands length
The body of my text posess extra strength
Power-liftin powerless up, out of this, towerin inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop past all your tall social hurdles
like the nationwide projects, prison-industry complex
Working class poor better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
for cha-ching cats get the CHA-POW, who dead now?
Killin fields need blood to graze the cash cow
some numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
but only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
so they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess, Michael Jackson was right, 'You Are Not Alone'
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
full of hard niggaz, large niggaz, dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whippin motherfucker's ass
You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics.

Eight year olds gettin found with 9 mill's
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal
He on the hill puffin krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers tryin to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new grind to get CREAM
The white unemployment rate, is nearly more than triple for black
so frontliners got they gun in your back
Bubblin crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
and end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin
join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces just lines and statistics
from your phone, your zip code, to S-S-I digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
Two columns for who is, and who ain't niggaz
Numbers is hardly real and they never have feelings
but you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret:
The million other straws underneath it - it's all mathematics!

[Chorus X2]

Linkin Park,Bleed It Out,Hip Hop,"And here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is you can stop and stare
Run myself out, and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
... this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I pull myself so far
I'll make you face, this, now

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out

A Tribe Called Quest,Find a Way,Hip Hop,"Chorus:
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in you confused things
Should I just sit out or come harder
Help me find my way

Messin' me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look, at what you starting
School boy crush, and it ain't on the hush
The whole world, see it, but you can't
My people's they complain, sittin' rave and rant
Your name is out my mouth like a ancient chant
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant

Speaking of which, got a leash and a wish, just to rock you miss
Make a militant move, peep my strategy
End of the day you're not mad at me
Not dealing with nobody now, that's what you told me
I said hey yo it's cool, we could just be friendly
Cause yo, picture me messin it up
Her mind I corrupt with the ill C-cups
Shiiit, I'm on my day off
Bullshittin, hopin' that the day go slow
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
It's kisses when we breeze, tell me what the deal yo

{Chorus} (2x)

Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we there
You doubts the whole vibe and it floats in the air
Tellin' me, bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga wit the plans
Who, got your heart in mind
It's about time that you just unwind

And let it just happen, make it front-free
Just sweat me like money paney
Diggin' you, gettin inside of your stee'
It's the quest cat, keepin you company
Forever or however you want it

Word word
Now wait a minute ma, before you dead into the curb
Try to make impressions which is good, not the herb
But it, it it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred
I'ma still just chill wit you
Maybe this'll change if you change your view
If not, then I guess it is cool
Just, keep to yourself and abide by the rules

Shake it out now (repeats)

Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock,It Takes Two,Hip Hop,"It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stoopid, I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
'Cause I'm the winner, no, I'm not the loser
To be an M.C. is what I choose 'a
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like the way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why, man, I don't know
So let's go, 'cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

My name is Rob, I gotta real funky concept
Listen up, 'cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea
That I wanna share
You don't like it? So what, I don't care
I'm number one, the uno, I like comp
Bring all the suckers 'cause all them I'll stomp
Bold and black but I won't protect
All of my followers 'cause all I want is respect
I'm not a doctor, put them in rapture
A slick brother that can easy outfox ya
Cause I'm Rob, the last name Base, yeah
And on the mike, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard
I won't fess, wear a bulletproof vest
Don't smoke buddha, can't stand sess, yes

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

The situation that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna lend
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
But listen up 'cause I want you to comprehend
'Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya and then ya get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes arenot counterfeit
The record sells which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt to listen to Red Alert
Take off your shirt
Make sure it don't hit the dirt
I like the kids--the guys, the girls
I want the ducats 'cause this is Rob Base's world
I'm on a mission, ya better just listen
To my rhymes 'cause I'm all about dissin'
'Cause

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

I stand alone, don't need anyone
'Cause I'm Rob, just came ot have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
'Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows
About things that make ya get weary
Don't cheer me, just hear me
Out 'cause I got the clout--shout (Ho!)
Before I turn the party out
I won't stutter--
Project my voice, speak clearly
So you can be my choice
On stage or on record
Go to the Wiz and select it
Take it off the rack, if it's wack put it back
I like the Whopper, fuck the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So, throw upyour hands
Go for what you know
Bro', I got an ego
Yo, talkin' to me? No
Oh
'Cause Rob is in the front, EZ Rock is on the Back up
We're not soft, soyou better just slack up
'Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mike with the help of EZ
Rock on the set, the music plays
Only cuts the records that I say

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it!

All right, now, EZ Rock
now, when I count to three
I want you ot get busy
You ready now?
One, two, three, get loose now!

Genesis,Firth of Fifth - New Stereo Mix,Hip Hop,"The path is clear, though no eyes can see
The course laid down long before
And so with gods and men, the sheep remain inside their pen
Though many times they've seen the way to leave

He rides majestic, past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy
To see reflected there, the trees, the sky, the lily fair
The scene of death is lying just below

The mountains cut off the town from view
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
Let it be revealed

A waterfall, his madrigal
An inland sea, his symphony

Undinal songs urge the sailors on
'Till lured by the siren's cry...

Now as the river dissolve in sea
So Neptune has claimed another soul
And so with gods and men, the sheep remain inside their pen
Until the shepherd leads his flock away

The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change",154

My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherf**ker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me


Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie? (homie)

Wish death upon me

Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherf**kers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Homie shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't f**king breathin'

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more

Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bonafied strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
deliberatley cheered LP filled with streeet goods
You can find it on the rack in your record store (store)
If you get the record, then your thoughts are adored
and appreciated, cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin out the plastic, do the dance till you spastic
If you dis... it gets drastic
Listen to the rhymes, cuz its time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby
All the way to Africa a.k.a. The Motherland (uh)
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black Man (man)
Only if you was noted as my man (man)
If I get the credit, then I'll think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
Cuz we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that (ass) (what?)
A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half (come on, come on)

Chorus:

We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on) (4X)

""Time.. time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an average of nothingness
Until it can be retarded for it's own destiny
TIME is an inanimate object
Praying and praying and praying for ??
Time is DANCING, moving lingering all memories of past..""
- The Last Poets

You gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these Excursions so you must realize
that continually, I pop my Zulu
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what could you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a (bitch), brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, at least that how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
It could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do to is know that the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare

Chorus

Edgar Allan Poe, it don't stop (uh!)

""Time is running out on black power Africans today
and whites blacks and reporters at night
Everytime you see them ?? with their tongues hangin out
Time is running and past and passing and running
Running and past and passing and running (excursions)""",678
Natalie Cole,Inseparable,Jazz,"Inseparable

We are just~

While you dwell within it

Childhood's joy land
Mi-istic merry toy land
Once you pass its borders
You can ne'er return again

When you've grown up my dears
And are as old as I
You'll laugh and ponder on the years

That roll so swi-iftly by-y

Mi-istic merry toy land
Once you pass its borders
You can ne'er return again",84
John Coltrane,Time After Time,Jazz,"She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no I'm a rocket man


Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man, a rocket man

And I think it's gonna be a long long time...",145
Billie Holiday,You Go to My Head - Take 1,Jazz,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself ""Get a hold of yourself""
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",177

Ella Fitzgerald,"Flyin' Home - Live At Carnegie Hall, New York / 1949",Jazz,"We're sitting out here on the runway,
Waiting for the plane to leave,
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay,
Bear with me please,""

They gave us the usual hassle,
""You can't take those guitars on board,""
But the boys in the band just smiled,
Heard it all before,

And as they're starting to serve champagne,
To the folks at the front of the plane,
I can hear the engines roaring, we're on our way, And we are flying home,
I feel the freedom in my soul,
Flying home at last;
Flying home,
I've got the freedom in my soul,
And it's four in the morning,
My world is calling,
Speeding through the universe tonight... The movie reminds of my lady,
As she waits, ""where are those guys?""
Yes it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky,

And now the sun is beginning to rise,
It's like looking down on Paradise,
There's a ball of fire that's burning, giving life, And we are flying home,
I feel the freedom in my soul,
Flying home at last;
Flying home,
I've got the freedom in my soul,
And it's four in the morning,
My world is calling,
Speeding through the universe tonight...",205
Oscar Peterson Trio,Just In Time,Jazz,"There's someone down below blowing you a kiss
They watch from their windows
As all arms fall to their sides
And all eyes fix on the death of tommorrow
And you found everything you need
To make a life complete
Completely revolting and they have safety and relief
For sale on the street
I see you in line everyday

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy

These creatures are waking up in these dark trees
Waiting like vultures
Eyes roll back turn white in time to feed
They salivate in hunger
For you and everything they need
To make a death complete
Completely unnatural and salvation lies
Behind those dead eyes that watch you while you sleep every night and...

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery

You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy....",215
Harry James,I Had The Craziest Dream,Jazz,"There you stand in your dungarees,
lookin all grown up and so very pleased.
When you write your poems they have so much to say,
when you speak your dreams it takes my breath away.
Ya know I wanna be a ball player,
a regular sluggin fool.
But I guess our dreams must wait awhile,
until we finish school.

{Chorus}
And so you and I,
we watch our years go by.
We watch our sweet dreams fly far away (away) but maybe someday,
I don't know when,
but we will dream again
and we'll be happy then until our time just drifts away.

There you stand in your wedding dress,
you're so beautiful I must confess
I m so proud you have chosen me,
when a doctor is what you wanna be.
Ya know I wanna be a painter girl,
a real artistic snob.
But I guess we'll have our children first,
you'll find a home I'll get a job.

{chorus}

Listen the seasons passing, listen to the wind blow.
Listen to the children laughing, where do broken dreams go?

There you stand in your tailored suit,
so many years gone by, but your still so cute.
You take the car to go and meet the bus,
when our grandchildren come to visit us.
And you say you shoula been a ballerina babe,
there are songs I shoulda sung,
But I guess our dreams have come and gone.
You're supposed to dream when you are young.

{Chorus}",247
George Olsen,My Papa Doesn't Two-Time No Time,Jazz,"These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time",298

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor


And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became the cry
Cause you remained in my heart, so
Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or lonely, lonely ashes of the flame, with you
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",122

Ella Fitzgerald,I Get A Kick Out Of You,Jazz,"Verse:
My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

Chorus:
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you


Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you",163
Ray Charles,That's Enough,Jazz,"Baby, if you want me to love you
Here's somethin' that you gotta do
You got to love me

You got to kiss me
(That's enough)
You got to squeeze me
(That's enough)
You got to miss me
You got to hold, hold me in your arms
And that's enough, well
Oh, that's enough
Baby if you want me for your man
There's a few things that you better understand
I want my baby
(That's enough)
I don't mean maybe
(That's enough)
I want my pretty baby
(That's enough)
Ain't talkin' maybe, no
You got to hold, hold me in your arms
And that's enough
Hey child, that's enough
Baby if you want me by your side",119
Nat King Cole,It's Only A Paper Moon - Remastered,Jazz,"It is only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

It is only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played
In a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade

Louis Armstrong,I Only Have Eyes For You,Jazz,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
And dear, I wonder if you find love
An optical illusion, too?

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",107

Sing it with your soul

Gloria Lynne,Long Ago and Far Away,Jazz,"Time flies
When you're having fun
I heard somebody say
But if all I've been is fun
Then baby let me go
Don't wanna be in your way
And I don't wanna be your second choice
Don't wanna be just your friend
You keep telling me that you're not in love
You wanna throw it all away

But I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control

Your love is slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you

Hold on to every bit of hope, that's all I ever do
Hoping you might change your mind
And call me up to say how much you need me too
And though you're leaving me no other choice
Than to turn and walk away
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there
You can count on me to stay ...

'Cause I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control

But it&amp;amp;acute;s uncomfortably near
My old heart ain&amp;amp;acute;t gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain&amp;amp;acute;t here

Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love&amp;amp;acute;s mispent
Mispent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Pardon me but I got to run
The fact&amp;amp;acute;s uncommonly clear
Got to find who&amp;amp;acute;s now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Oh, where is my angel eyes

Excuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes, angel eyes.

You're increasingly sweet,
so whenever we happen to meet
I greet you ...

REFRAIN
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
but it's soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching your hand
It tells that you're standing near, and ..
At the sound of your voice
heaven opens its portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
that a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
with a song in my heart for you.",144
Nat King Cole,Away In A Manger,Jazz,"So far away, doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away

Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could, but you're so far away

One more song about movin' along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it bein' close to you.

But you're so far away, doesn't anybody stay in one place any more
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away

Travelin' around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothin' else to do but close my mind
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams
I've yet to find

But your so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away...",193

When you're gone and I'm all by myself
And I need your caress

I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay

I just think of you
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes I love you so
And that for me
Is all I need to know

I will wait for you
'Till the sun falls from out of the sky
For what else can I do

I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me

I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be

George Olsen,She's A Corn-Fed Indiana Girl,Jazz,"Never seen such a beautiful girl
Got me shaking inside
Calling on me from deep within her eyes
Not the kind you go handing around
Want to keep her right there
But this love it don't come as no surprise

And when I saw the way that she smiled at me
I knew it there and then that she was A 1
And then I felt the way she was touching me
Was something I had known I was waiting upon

Never seen such a beautiful girl
Had me quickly untied
Calling to me she made me realize
Not the kind that is lost or is found
She has always been there
A lover needed for this soul to survive

And when I saw the way that she smiled at me
I knew it there and then that she was A1
And when I felt the way she got through to me
Was something I had know I was waiting upon

Judy Garland,Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart,Jazz,"4. ZING! WENT THE STRINGS OF MY HEART

Dear when you smiled at me,
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
'Twas like a breath of spring,
I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through ""I love you, love you""
I still recall the thrill,
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody devine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Glenn Miller,Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (with Anyone Else but Me),Jazz,"- written by Lew Brown, Charles Tobias and Sam H. Stept
- lyrics as recorded in New York City on February 18, 1942 by
Glenn Miller and His Orchestra (two months after the attack
on Pearl Harbor). The male vocals on the recording were by
Ray Eberle and the Modernaires. The female vocals were by
Marion Hutton (Betty Hutton's sister).

{male vocals}
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

Don't go walkin' down Lover's Lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't go walkin' down Lover's Lane with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

I just got word from a guy who heard from the guy next door to me
The girl he met just loves to pet and it fits you to-a-tee
So, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

{female vocals}
Don't give out with those lips of yours to anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Watch the girls on the foreign shores, you'll have to report to me
When you come marchin' home

Don't hold anyone on your knee, you better be true to me
You better be true to me, you better be true to me
Don't hold anyone on your knee, you're gettin' the third degree
When you come marchin' home

You're on your own where there is no phone and I can't keep tab on you
Be fair to me, I'll guarantee this is one thing that I'll do
I won't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but you
Till you come marchin' home

{all}
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
I know the apple tree is reserved for you and me
And I'll be true till you come marchin' home",346

And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start

Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

If you have built a boat to take you to the greener side
And if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied
You'll never reach the Promised Land of love, I guarantee
'cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
'cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

The autumn leaves of red and gold

The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C’est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m’aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous, les deux ensemble

Would fill the earth

Johnny Hartman,A Slow Hot Wind,Jazz,"Love me, love me; say you do.
Let me fly away with you.
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind.
Give me more than one caress;
Satisfy this hungriness.
Let the wind blow through your heart,
For wild is the wind.

*You touch me;
I hear the sound of mandolins.
You kiss me,
And, with the kiss, the world begins.
You're spring to me, all things to me;
You're life itself!
Like a leaf clings to a tree,
Oh my darling, cling to me,
For we're creatures of the wind,
And wild is the wind, the wind.
Wild is my love for you.

Miles Davis,Circle,Jazz,"(Jazz instrumental)
Album notes:
Miles Smiles is an album recorded in October 1966 by the Miles Davis quintet.

On three tracks from this album (""Orbits"", ""Dolores"", ""Gingerbread Boy""), Herbie Hancock takes the unusual step of dispensing with left hand chords and playing only right hand lines.
Somewhat unusually for this group, the album includes two compositions not written by members of the group. Both are treated far more freely and loosely than the original versions. In addition, an earlier and more conservative recording of Wayne Shorter's ""Footprints"" appears on his album Adam's Apple.
Three of the album's compositions are known to have made it to Davis's live ""book"". ""Dolores"" is known from a single recording in the spring of 1967. ""Gingerbread Boy"" and ""Footprints"" were played much more frequently. ""Gingerbread Boy"" was played as late as the summer of 1969; ""Footprints"" appears on unofficial live recordings from the Fillmore West in April 1970.
Early live versions of ""Gingerbread Boy"" (from the spring and summer of 1966) retained the melody of Heath's original version. The melody on the studio version is slightly different (presumably changed by Davis), and ensuing versions retain this change.",192
Bobby Darin,Mack the Knife,Jazz,"Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it, out of sight
You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears old Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk, ooh, sunny morning, uh-huh
Lies a body just oozin' life
Eek, and someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat, down by the river, don't ya know
Where a cement bag's just a-droopin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town

Now d'ya hear about Louie Miller?
He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now Jenny Diver, ho, ho, yeah, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town

Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
Look out ol' Macky is back",223

George Shearing,I Didn't Know What Time It Was,Jazz,"These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time",298

But if you say a thing about it, you be in trouble with the man.

Ah let the Midnight Special shine a light on me,
Oh let the Midnight Special shine its ever lovin' light on me,

Now if you're ever in Houston, oh, you better walk right;
Aw, you better not gamble boy, I say you better not fight, l
Or the sheriff he will grab you and the boys will pull you down.
And then before you know it, you're penitentary bound.

Ah let the Midnight Special shine a light on me, (woooo)
Let the Midnight Special shine its ever lovin' light on me,

Here comes miss Lucy, how in the world did you know?
I can tell by her apron, and by the clothes she wore.
An umbrella on her shoulder, she got a paper in her hand;
She come to see the warden, to try to free her man.

So let the Midnight Special shine a light on me,
Ah let the Midnight Special shine its everlovin' light on me.
I said let the Midnight Special shine a light on me,
Ah let the Midnight Special shine its everlovin' light on me.",235

Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you
The organ was playing

""Your dreams, your dreams are through""

A vision of loveliness
I uttered a sigh, whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Your mother was crying
Your father was crying


And I was crying too
The teardrops were falling
Because we were losin' you

She came down the aisle, wearing a smile

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far

If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see
There's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one thirty-three

How can I ignore
The boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way

And though I'm heart-sore

Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

While my mother baked a little cake for you
And even dreaded when you said goodbye

What kind of cartwheels do I have to pull?
What kind of joke should I lay on her now?
I'm inclined to go finish high school
Just to make her notice that I'm around

Well nothing I came up with seems to work
It feels like everything I say is lie
And never have I felt like such a jerk
I'm afraid to even open my eyes
Because I really don't want her to judge me
I want her to really know who I am
And then, and only then will she love me
Well at least that was the plan

If ever a boy needed a holiday
If ever a girl needed someone to hold
I just hope I don't act the same way
By the time I get that old

What kind of cartwheels do I have to pull?
What kind of joke should I lay on her now?
I'm inclined to go finish high school

Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",177
Ella Fitzgerald,That Old Black Magic,Jazz,"That old black magic's got me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers
Up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
And when that elevator starts its ride
Darling down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You're the lover
You're the lover
You're the lover
You're the lover
I have waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And everytime your lips meet mine

Darling down and down I go,
Round and Round I go
In a spin, I'm loving the spin that I'm in
I'm Under that old black magic called love

Yes I'm in a spin, I'm loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Got me spinning and spinning and spinning around
Like an elevator's going down
In this magic, black magic called love",198
Fred Astaire,A Fine Romance - Alternate Take,Jazz,"A fine romance with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend, this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes (to-mah-toes, dear)
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed po-tah-toes (potatoes)

A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't even wrestle
You've never mussed the crease in my blue serge pants
You never take a chance, this is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take Jello
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins to express emotion

A fine romance, my dear Duchess
Two old fogies, we really need crutches
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France! (Fronce)
I haven't got a chonce (chance), this is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong, aged-in-the-wood woman
You never give those orchids I send a glance
They're just like cactus plants, (oh boy)
This is a fine romance!",163
Doris Day,Winter Wonderland,Jazz,"Over the ground lies a mantle of white,
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night,
Two hearts are thrillin', in spite of the chill in
The weather

Love knows no seasons, love knows no climb,
Romance can blossom, any old time,
Here in the open, We're walkin'
Together

Sleighbells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful site, We're happy tonight,
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings his love song, As we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, &quot;Are You Married?&quot;, We'll say &quot;No Man!&quot;
&quot;But you can do the job when your in town!&quot;

Later on, We'll conspire,
As we dream, by the fire,
To face unafraid, the plans we made,
Walkin' in a winter wonderlan-hand
Walkin' in a winter, wonderland",160
Billie Holiday,I Wish I Had You - Take 1,Jazz,"Dorothy Parker / Ralph Rainger

I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you",78
Vince Guaraldi Trio,Greensleeves,Jazz,"Alas, my love, you do me wrong,
To cast me off discourteously.
For I have loved you well and long,
Delighting in your company.

Chorus:
Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
And who but my lady greensleeves.

Your vows you've broken, like my heart,
Oh, why did you so enrapture me?
Now I remain in a world apart
But my heart remains in captivity.

Chorus

I have been ready at your hand,
To grant whatever you would crave,
I have both wagered life and land,
Your love and good-will for to have.

Chorus

If you intend thus to disdain,
It does the more enrapture me,
And even so, I still remain
A lover in captivity.

Chorus

My men were clothed all in green,
And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Chorus

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
but still thou hadst it readily.
Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

Chorus

Well, I will pray to God on high,
that thou my constancy mayst see,
And that yet once before I die,
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

Chorus

Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,
To God I pray to prosper thee,
For I am still thy lover true,
Come once again and love me.",234

Chet Baker,My Ideal,Jazz,"Long ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh what a fantasy

Thought the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy

Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal",129

That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite
With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the keys and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster.....

CHORUS:
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby..oh..ho..ohhhhh

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster.....faster

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey

Billie Holiday,But Not For Me,Jazz,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me.
A lucky star's above, but not for me.
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of grey
than any Russain play could guarantee.
I was a fool to fall and get that way;
Heigh-ho! Alas! And also, lack-a-day!
Although I can't dismiss the mem'ry of his kiss, I guess he's not for me.

He's knocking on a door, but not for me.
He'll plan a two by four, but not for me.
I know that love's a game;
I'm puzzled, just the same,
was I the moth or flame?
I'm all at sea.
It all began so well, but what an end!
This is the time a feller needs a friend,
when ev'ry happy plot ends with the marriage knot,
and there's no knot for me.",138

Charles Mingus,These Foolish Things - Remind Me of You,Jazz,"Take your ring
Isn’t it strange your always leaving things
Never mind I know this rule is not a whole
I hope I made you feel less alone

It is no strange
But it’s more, more than just a night of fling
There are things I believe should never be told, girl no
But you’re the only one I want to hold
Cause it can get awfully cold

You know our love is
such a wonderful thing
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear
Send my love to the next, somewhere

Dee Dee, Keep the ring
Ain’t it funny, right
I’m always losing things
But you’re like me you’ve known roaming
I hope I made you feel less alone
Think of me as you roam

Oh, precious thing
You know our love is
such a wonderful thing
Girl, you make me dizzy whispering in my ear
It’s you my love, till the next, somewhere

You say no strings
But freedom is still as
much yours as my thing
I know promises can be hard to keep
The price I paid to
learn, oh baby was just
too steep
But my still my love runs deep

And you're going shake me down somehow.
But what's the use, you've cooked my goose,
Cause you took advantage of me.

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know my elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go, it's much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned.
So lock the doors and call me yours,
Cause you took advantage of me.

I have no will, you've made your kill,
Cause you took advantage of me.

Tell me, what's the use, you've cooked my goose,
Cause you took advantage of me.

I suffer something awful each time you go, it's much worse when you're near.

When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

Bite the hand that feeds

Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky, take me to heaven

Think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though
It never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye

Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near

Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever

Every night the dreams return to haunt me
Your rosary wrapped around your throat
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep
I see your face looking back at me

From the eyes of a stranger

No happy ending like they've always promised
There's got to be something left for me

And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided
Surely will not stand

No foolish naive stand

The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homelands

Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement
Gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than-thou-could-be-messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die, they die

They killed my wife and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake.....last mistake!
Paid by the alliance, to slay all the giants
Next mistake.....no more mistakes!

Fill the cracks in, with judical granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinkin' it

Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture it's jaw to let me be

Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Where does christmas go,&quot; they asked &quot;And what does christmas do?&quot; Now children have such simple requests Their wishes are so small That the young man saw no reason why He could not grant them all They liked his stories so much They begged him not to let it end So he told them about the wizards of winter Whose winter ball they must attend How these wizards decorated their whole world With icicles, frost and snow And how with the dreams of this night beneath it It all would magically start to glow And the snow seemed to obey the young man's every gesture In the cold december's air And as for the wizards' imperial ball Well, they were already there",234

There's more than meets the eye
'round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil.

There sat a seven-headed beast, ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot.

She's a dwelling place for demons,
she's a cage for every unclean spirit and every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.

The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour.

Merchants and captains of the world, sailors navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with their sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot.

She's a dwelling place for demons,
she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.

The day has come for all us sinners,
If you're not a servant you'll be struck to the ground.
Flee the burning, greedy city,
Looking back on her to see there's nothin' around.

I don't believe in fairytales and no one wants to go to Hell,
you've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see.
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us,
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever.

She's a dwelling place for demons,
she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings.
Fallen now is Babylon the Great.

And he has watched and he has pondered: ""What is laughter, what are tears?""

And he's never found his answers as he sees the years go by

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine

You are the dancing queen

Leave 'em burning and then you're gone

Ed Sheeran,Thinking out Loud,Pop,"Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

Looking Glass,Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) - Single Version,Pop,"(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda)

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say &quot;Brandy, fetch another round&quot;
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say &quot;Brandy, you're a fine girl&quot; (you're a fine girl)
&quot;What a good wife you would be&quot; (such a fine girl)
&quot;Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea&quot;
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loves

He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailor said &quot; Brandy, you're a fine girl&quot; (you're a fine girl)


&quot;What a good wife you would be&quot; (such a fine girl)
&quot;But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea&quot;
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its ragin' glory
But he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

She hears him say &quot; Brandy, you're a fine girl&quot; (you're a fine girl)
&quot;What a good wife you would be&quot; (such a fine girl)
&quot;But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea&quot;

And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going

And you said it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I dragged you back a sleepyhead

They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls against your rules against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Of your eyes, begonia skies like a sleepyhead

Someone to believe in
Please send me someone I can hold

A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that lays and waits inside your heart
It still astounds me
The way you found me
It's almost too good
To be true
From our first meeting
I had the feeling
The rest of my life
I'd spend with you
I can't just turn my back
On everything I've heard you say
I'm into you in every way

not you.

Another heart has made the trade,
Forget it, forget it, forget it,
I don't understand how a heart is a spade,
But somehow the vital connection is made.

Riding on anything,
Anything's good enough,
Who would've thought it of
Someone like you,
Just as they brought me round,
Now that they brought you down,
Roundabout and roundabout
Who wants a life anyway?

Another heart has made the grade,

All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
All the light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand",313
Anthem Lights,K-Love Fan Awards: Songs of the Year (2014 Mash-Up),Pop,"Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize,
I guess you had your way.
You see I've gotta make you understand.
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say,
But it don't matter baby, 'cos today's another day

CHORUS
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life and let me see...

Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it.
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on.
I know you've heard it all before,
But I realy need you, darlin', every day I need you more...

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better,
You came home without a word.
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her,
They couldn't see it and they just didn't understand,
And lookin' in the mirror, there were fools at either hand,

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you,
I really can't believe,
We're walkin' out into the world tonight,
We'll do it all again until the break of night,
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes.

CHORUS",252

Billy Vaughn,Sail Along Silv'ry Moon,Pop,"Well it's a rainy night in Paris
And I'm sitting by the Seine
It's a pleasure to be soaking
In the European rain
Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine
But in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line

Sweet Virginia Cigarette
Burning in my hand
Well you used to be a friend of mine
But now I understand
You've been eating up inside me for some time
But I know your gonna get me
Somewhere along the line

Somewhere along the line
Well I know it's just a matter of time
When the fun falls through and the rent comes due
Somewhere along the line

Well, you know I love my woman
And I would not let her down
And I did my share of lovin'
When I used to get around
Now I'm satisfied that she is lookin' fine
But you pay for your satisfaction
Somewhere along the line

Hey, it's good to be a young man
And to live the way you please
Yes, a young man is the king
Of every kingdom that he sees
There's an old and feeble man not far behind
But it surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line",206

That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself

The Monkees,She - Original Stereo Version; 2006 Remaster,Pop,"Words and Music by
Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart

She, she told me that she loved me,
And like a fool I believed her from the start.
She, she said she'd never hurt me,
But then she turned around and broke my heart

Why am I standing here,
Missing her and wishing she were here.
She only did me wrong;
I'm better off alone.

She, she devoured all my sweet love,
Took all I had and then she fed me dirt.
She, she laughed while I was cryin'.
It was such a joke to see the way it hurt.

Why am I standing here,
Missing her and wishing she were here.
She only did me wrong;
I'm better off alone.

And now I know just why she
Keeps me hangin' 'round.
She needs someone to walk on,
So her feet don't touch the ground.
But I love her,
I need her,
I want her.
Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! She!

[Instrumental]

Why am I standing here,
Missing her and wishing she were here.
She only did me wrong now;
I'm better off alone.

Why am I missing her?
I should be kissing her.

The Beach Boys,Catch A Wave - Stereo/Remastered 2001,Pop,"Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world

Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
Everybody tries it once
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long
All the surfers going strong
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon
And watch 'em they'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world

Catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world

So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
Every Saturday boy
But don't treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world

Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world",218

'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away

I might be a king and steal my peoples things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule but I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way

I could chase around for nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes but I'll come back in style
For I realise your love means more than anything

Belle & Sebastian,The Boy With The Arab Strap,Pop,"A mile and a half on a bus takes a long time
The odour of old prison food takes a long time to pass you by
When you've been inside
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down
Nobody gives you a chance or a dollar in this old town

Hovering silence from you is a giveaway
Squalor and smoke's not your style
""I don't like this place""
We better go
Then I compare notes with your older sister
I am a lazy gett, she is as pure as the cold driven snow
She accepts my confession

What did you learn from your time in the solitary
Cell of your mind?
There was noises, distractions from anything good
And the old prison food
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
Cause anything's better than posh isolation
1 missed the bus
You were laid on your back
With the boy from the arab strap
With the boy from the arab strap

It's something to speak of the way you are feeling
To crowds there assembled
Do you ever feel you have gone too far?
Everyone suffers in silence a burden
The man who drives minicabs down in Old Compton
The Asian man
With his love hate affair
With his racist clientele

A central location for you is a must as you stagger about making free with your lewd and lascivious boasts
We know you are soft cause we've all seen you dancing
We know you are hard cause we all saw you drinking from noon
Until noon again
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
You're the boy with the arab strap

Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the cigarette catches
And sets off the smoke alarm
What do you make of the cool set in London?
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks
She's a waitress and she's got style
Sunday bathtime could take a while",333
AZ,Sugar Hill,Pop,"Chorus: i wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on
bubbly)

At times i wanna watch out the Mariot, zoning on owning co-ops,
foreign drop top coups, and yachts guzzling straight shots a scotch,
formulating up plots ta escape from Salems lock cuz its scorching hot,
making it hard trying ta figure who's out ta trap me, Pataki, got all
kinds of undercovers coming at me, perhaps he, won't be happy, til they
snatch me, and place me where half slacks be, sitting in Catsaki, but
never me, see, my destiny ta be forever free, in ecstacy, on a hill
that awaits for me, so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush,
vivid enough ta make living this a must, plus this is real

CHORUS
first line &amp; (sugar hill baby, sugar hill baby)
second line &amp; (ayo son pull the shades down and lets count this money
put the grants in the safe, cuz we spending the jacksons, the
washingtons go to wify, ya know how we do)

No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubberbands, i'm a
recovered man, our plans ta discover other lands, suburban places got me
seeking for oasis, cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime
faces, sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas, though this ain't
promised, I'm as determined as them old timers, I wanna villa in a Costa
Rica, so i can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta treat
ya, laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid, wearing
the finest fabrics tailors ever made, me and my team, carrabeans
forseen, i guess being down for so long i'm all in store ta see my
dreams
Chorus
so until i see past the green pasture, me being supreme master, ain't
much more life ta feind after, but another chapter, a new way of life to
adap ta, cuz these streets a gas ya,and have ya caught up in the rapture
de ja vouz, i could vision my killa crew, more hospitable, consciously
aware plus political, cuz though they claim that every man created equal
whats his native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through,
but once established we living lavish, like the house of versi, paris,
i gotta have it, it so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush,
vivid enough, ta make living this a must, plu this is real

Chorus 3x
ending: its so crazy im down wit AZ, its so lovely sippin on bubbly
its so crazy jones and AZ, its so lovely sippin on bubbly

Lulu,To Sir with Love,Pop,"Don Black; Mark London.

Those schoolgirl days, of telling tales and biting nails are gone,
But in my mind,
I know they will still live on and on,
But how do you thank someone, who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try,

If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters,
That would soar a thousand feet high,
To Sir, with Love

The time has come,
For closing books and long last looks must end,
And as I leave,
I know that I am leaving my best friend,
A friend who taught me right from wrong,
And weak from strong,
That's a lot to learn,
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start,
But I, would rather you let me give my heart,
To Sir, with Love",149
Anthem Lights,K-Love Fan Awards: Songs of the Year (2014 Mash-Up),Pop,"Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize,
I guess you had your way.
You see I've gotta make you understand.
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say,
But it don't matter baby, 'cos today's another day

CHORUS
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life and let me see...

Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it.
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on.
I know you've heard it all before,
But I realy need you, darlin', every day I need you more...

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better,
You came home without a word.
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her,
They couldn't see it and they just didn't understand,
And lookin' in the mirror, there were fools at either hand,

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you,
I really can't believe,
We're walkin' out into the world tonight,
We'll do it all again until the break of night,
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes.

Christina Aguilera,"Reflection - From ""Mulan"" / Pop Version",Pop,"Look at me
You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

I am now
In a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

There's a heart that must be
Free to fly
That burns with a need to know
The reason why

Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?",207

ABBA,The Winner Takes It All,Pop,"I don’t wanna talk
about the things we’ve gone through
though it’s hurting me
now it’s history
I’ve played all my cards
and that’s what you’ve done too
nothing more to say
no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
the loser standing small
beside the victory
that’s her destiny

I was in your arms
thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
building me a fence
building me a home
thinking I’d be strong there
but I was a fool
playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
their minds as cold as ice
and someone way down here
loses someone dear
the winner takes it all
the loser has to fall
it’s simple and it’s plain
why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
like I used to kiss you
does it feel the same
when she calls your name
somewhere deep inside
you must know I miss you
but what can I say
rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
the likes of me abide
spectators of the show
always staying low
the game is on again
a lover or a friend
a big thing or a small
the winner takes it all

I don’t wanna talk
if it makes you feel sad
and I understand
you’ve come to shake my hand
I apologise
if it makes you feel bad
seeing me so tense
no self-confidence

But you see
the winner takes it all",245

The Cardigans,Lovefool,Pop,"Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do!

So I cry, and I pray and I beg

Love me love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

So I cried, and I begged for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not reach a solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, I pray and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me

So I cried, and I begged for you to
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me, love me
I know that you need me
I can't care about anything but you",298
The Beach Boys,I'm Waiting For The Day - Remastered,Pop,"I hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why

I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

So many people love you baby
That must be what you are

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition

I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

But I can't love you this much baby
And love you from this far

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting
(I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting
(Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
that's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah",286
Anthem Lights,K-Love Fan Awards: Songs of the Year (2014 Mash-Up),Pop,"Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize,
I guess you had your way.
You see I've gotta make you understand.
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say,
But it don't matter baby, 'cos today's another day

CHORUS
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life and let me see...

Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it.
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on.
I know you've heard it all before,
But I realy need you, darlin', every day I need you more...

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better,
You came home without a word.
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her,
They couldn't see it and they just didn't understand,
And lookin' in the mirror, there were fools at either hand,

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you,
I really can't believe,
We're walkin' out into the world tonight,
We'll do it all again until the break of night,
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes.

Lily Allen,Smile,Pop,"When you first left me I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door,
What ya do that for? (What ya do that for?)
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
I've never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry,
Yeah it makes me smile, yeah it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for a while,
But then I just smile I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me you say that
You want me back(Want be back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack,(It don't mean jack)
No it don't mean jack(No it don't mean jack)
I couldn't stop laughing,
No I just couldn't help myself
See you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feeling alone

Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home,

Daniel Bedingfield,If You're Not The One,Pop,"If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all

I never know what the future brings
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand

Onetta here in the corner stands
And wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything

9AM on the hour hand and
She's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
She's waiting for her clientèle

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there

It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
just to hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She already knows
She's seen her bad times
She already knows
These are the good times

She'll never sell out
she never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works hard

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Shania Twain,Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You),Pop,"You’re so complicated - you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don’t appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they’re on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I’m really feelin’ frustrated
Why don’t you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you’ll see

Don’t freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It’s definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don’t freak out until you know the facts
Relax - Max

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Don’t be stupid - you’re my baby

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)

Sun shining on your eyes
Sleepy face
Smiling into mine
Sunday morning
Lots of time with nothing to do
Lots of time to spend with you
on Sunday morning
It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sounds of feet walking by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do
What other people do
on Sunday morning

Sunday morning Sunday morning
Sunday Sunday I love Sunday

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything is all right

This is Mambo No.5

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody's in the car, so come on
Let's ride to the liqueur-store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna

Beerbust like I had last week
I must stay deep
Because talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know
They are getting sweeter

So what can I do I really beg and you my Lord
To me flirting it's just like sport, anything fly
It's all good let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Mambo No.5

Jump up and down go and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hand on the ground
Take one step left
And one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once
And clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this
Then you are doing it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Trumpet

A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

I do all
To fall in love with a girl like you
You can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky

And folks all dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows that turkey and some mistletoe
Will help to make the season bright
And tiny tots with their eyes all a glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,

Frank Ocean,Swim Good,Pop,"When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year

It was a massive good year",159

Les Paul,I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles,Pop,"It was a slow day
And the sun was beating
On the soldiers by the side of the road
There was a bright light
A shattering of shop windows
The bomb in the baby carriage
Was wired to the radio

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

It was a dry wind
And it swept across the desert
And it curled into the circle of birth
And the dead sand
Falling on the children
And the mothers and the fathers
And the automatic earth

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all, oh yeah
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

It's a turn around jump shot
It's everybody jump start
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Medicine is magical and magical is art, think of
The boy in the bubble
And the baby with the baboon heart

And I believe
These are days of lasers in the jungle
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
Staccato signals of constant information
A loose affiliation of millionaires
And billionaires, and baby

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all, oh yeah

Frank Ocean,Sweet Life,Pop,"That's life, that's what all the people say.
You're riding high in April,
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune,
When I'm back on top, back on top in June.

I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks,
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down,
'Cause this fine ol' world it keeps spinning around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate,
A poet, a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself, flat on my face,
I pick myself up and get back in the race.

That's life
I tell ya, I can't deny it,
I thought of quitting baby,
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try,
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate,
A poet, a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face,
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
That's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out
But my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shakin' come this here july
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die

Just to leave the folk music behind
Zal and Denny workin' for a penny
Tryin' to get a fish on the line
In a coffee house Sebastian sat
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher in L.A.
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass

Zally said, Denny, you know there aren't many
Who can sing a song the way that you do; let's go south
Denny said, Zally, golly, don't you think that I wish
I could play guitar like you

Take me to New York right away

Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps
McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher
But that's what they were aimin' at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass

Cass can't make it; she says we'll have to fake it

Tell me now, How do I feel

Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how should I feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I heard you speak

Way, way, way, we way back in the days the year, 1980.
had to get a job, had to make some money-ney
picked up a pen and a pad,
dropped reality never thinking that I
would live to see the day I'd rock my own CD

We used to do the dance we called obie-obie
Now S.T.P. 1993, so Hollywood get out my way
My mom's words seems like yesterday
""Love Jesus, don't forget to pray""
She most have gone with the boss D.J. Right?

and feelin though, skinny coming with the 9mm

and respect to the man with the Uzi

and this beat's cooking like an Italian
It wasn't hard for me to do, it so easy
because to me loops loops tight go naturally
Mom's words seem like yesterday.

What's your name? Cisco Kid.
Si, Poncho's name is, Poncho.

now in '94 we got an S.T.P.
a half pack of smokes, and oh yes, and Sammy
A fifteen pack of Old Millwalkee
A Dalmation and a girlfriend,
but I ain't got no money-ne-ne-ne

The 808 is within my reach,
sublime beats are comin' straight from long beach.
If you think that hollywood
didn't get what he deserved,
call 808 kit to get served

How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy, man?

There's always some hombre that can't resist swapin' lead,
just to see if their faster with the six gun than Cisco is.

They'll only find out Cisco is fastet.

Well that don't stop 'em from tryin' Poncho,
like Slade here,
he fancys himself as fast on the draw as a quarter-horse
takin' after a stray.

What's the matter? Can't the Cisco Kid talk for himself?
Is that how you got your reputation Cisco,
By havin' your partner build you up?

I make no claim to a reputation senor,
and no one has to talk for me.

The Cisco Kid, heh,.
the kid part fits you from the way you act.

I've meet with your kind before.
You a foolish hombre if you think he will not fight you.

Your making big talk for an hombre who will not fight.

You are wrong Slade,
I'll fight you any place, any time.
If there is a good reason.

Well here's a fist full of reasons!

Now you two quit that.

Just as soon as I finish off this Cisco Kid.

You are the one that is finished you faggot.

Is that a good punch?

Alright you two, that's enough,
let him alone Cisco.

I won't forget this Cisco,
I'll take this up with you another time.

Any time hombre,
I'd be glad to accomidate you.

I'll make it soon Cisco.

And keep pretending the sun will not rise

Attracted by some force within it

I could get used to it
Around the corner where a puppet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence
where children play
Saw them dance where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
The car screeched in the sand
and dust
Feel encouraged -
just a car on it's side
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled it close by the buildin's side
In a room for forgotten youth
I could think
or let my senses slide
Turned on to a night with you
Find the place where my friends, won't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine
and I had no time to lose
Yeah looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark street,
the houses looked the same
Stopped and turned around,
held me to a game
I walked round and round,
you nailed me to a tree
Trying to find a way,
trying to find a way, to get out
For twelve windows stand in a row
Behind a wall
where a room to go
The light shined like a neon show
See the deep mellow warmth
of the glow
No place to stop,
no place to go
No time to lose,
have to keep on going

I guess they died some time ago

And always did what we were told.

But we’ve been sweating while you slept so calm,
In the safety of your home.
We’ve been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you’ve known.

Are guiding the way.

We’ll sing through the day,
Of the lives that we’ve lost,
And the lives we’ve reclaimed.

I don’t need your help now,

Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights

And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

Apathy has rained on me
And now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I don't mind
I've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell, who needs them anyway.

Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
Oh my lola lo-lo-lo-lo lola lo-lo-lo-lo lola

Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said dear boy won’t you come home with me

I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees

And I always want it to be that way for my lola

And I’d never ever kissed a woman before

The Smiths,Cemetry Gates - 2017 Master,Punk,"A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
I want to cry
You say: ""Ere thrice the sun hath done
salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose or poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'
There's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall
You say: ""Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
'Some dizzy whore', 1804
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side

Now when I look out through your eyes
I am young again even though I'm very old

Her very Lowness with her head in a sling

I say: ""Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?""

And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed or have I changed?
As some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs
(I swear to God, I swear)
I never even knew what drugs were
And so I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: ""Eh, I know and you cannot sing!""
I said: ""That's nothing, you should hear me play piano!""

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron
No one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
There are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
These are the things that kill me

I am going, I am going

Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me
But the rope always was slack
And now that I've a pile
I'll go down to the Chelsea
I'll walk in on my feet
But I'll leave there on my back

Because I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke
Seemed the wisest of philosophies
There's nothing ever gained
By a wet thing called a tear
When the world is too dark
And I need the light inside of me
I'll walk into a bar
And drink fifteen pints of beer

Iam going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going

""Oh you've been in the house too long"", she said

At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

Bad Brains,Pay to Cum,Punk,"I make decisions with precision,
Lost inside this manned collision,
Just to see that what to be is,
Perfectly my fantasy,
I came to know with now dismay,
That in this world we all must pay,
Pay to write, pay to play, pay to cum, pay to fight!
And all in time,
With just our minds,
We soon will find what's left behind,
Not long ago when things were slow,
We all got by with what we know,
The end is near,
Hearts filled with fear,
Don't want to listen to what they hear,
And so it's now we choose to fight,
To stick up for our bloody right,
The right to ring, the right to dance, the right to dance,
The right is ours...we'll take the chance!!

A Piece apart,
A piece of wisdom,
From our hearts.",141

My heart reached out for you

And feel obliged to start again

That there are things in life
That one can't quite express

You know this scene is very humdrum

Social Distortion,Story of My Life,Punk,"High school seemed like such a blur,
I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections.
And in class I dreamed all day,
Of a rock 'n' roll weekend

And the girl in the front of the room,
So close yet so far y'know she never seemed to notice
That this silly schoolboy crush
Wasn't just pretend.

[Chorus:]
Life goes by so fast
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past;
Story of my life

And I went down my old neighborhood
The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to
And the pool hall I loved as a kid
Is now a Seven Eleven

I went downtown to look for a job
I had no training, no experience to speak of.
I looked at the holes in my jeans
And turned and headed back.

[Chorus]

Good times come and good times go,
I only wish the good times would last a little longer.
I think about the good times we had
And why they had to end.

So I sit at the edge of my bed
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song.
Thinkin' 'bout what you're doin' now
And when you're comin' back.

And worry all the whores

And queers in the GLC
And when we've done those bastards in
We'll storm the BBC

To a Soho sex-shop dream
From a fried egg in Valtaro's
To a Tottenham Court Road ice cream
We'll spew and lurch, get nicked and fixed
On the way we'll kill and maim
When you haven't got a penny, boys
It's all the bloody same

Going transmetropolitan
From Pentonville Road on a sunset eve
To the beauty that's Mill Lane

And I'm not going home tonight

This town has done us dirty
This town has bled us dry
We've been here for a long time
And we'll be here 'til we die
So we'll finish off the leavings
Of blood and glue and beer
And burn this bloody city down
In the summer of the year

To the Scottish shores today

Still need her so

As it was logwood burnin' through the nights.
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,

Only Rasta can liberate the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute, they don't like you

Verse 1:

Why try to make I unhappy
Really I don't know
If it was up to them my friend
We would never see the sun nor the snow
Through that mystical communication within
We keep on coming together
I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another
That's the way it should be
Not contrary, stop tearing down each other

Chorus:

Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you

Verse 2:

Hard drugs won't do
You're just behaving like they want you to
Arrogance is much different from ignorance
And I know you feel the same way too
Many live this life without having a clue
No reason why they are so sad and blue
Places to go so much things to do
Not a moment to reflect on the cycle of life

Chorus:

A who free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you


Jah free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe one minute, they don't like you

Verse 3:

It hard, it hard, it hard
Mek them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard
Let them know
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard
Let them know we waan go home a we yard
It hard, it hard, it hard
Oh God, we waan go home!

Chorus:

Only Rasta free the people
Over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't believe for a minute that they are with you
Jah free the people
Those over hills and valleys too
Don't let them fool you
Don't their believe one minute they don't like you

Repeat Verse 1:

Why try to make I unhappy

And I love to see brothers and sisters
Looking out for one another

Bob Marley & The Wailers,Misty Morning,Reggae,"Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin',
The dogs 'll lose their bark.
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind,
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.

From the crossroads of my doorstep,
My eyes they start to fade,
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid.
And I gaze back to the street,
The sidewalk and the sign,
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.

It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good,
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
You can say it just as good.
You're right from your side,
I'm right from mine.
We're both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.",143

Peter Tosh,(You Gotta Walk) Don't Look Back - 2002 Remaster,Reggae,"If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Now if your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
Don't kill your faith in love

Bob Marley & The Wailers,So Much Things To Say,Reggae,"A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes
I'm looking up into the sapphire tempered skies
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose
Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care but - things have changed.
This place ain't doin' me any good
I'm in the wrong town, I should've been in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancin' lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he got anythin' to prove
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care but - things have changed.
I've been walkin' forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right the world will explode
I'm tryin' to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can't win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Puttin' her in a wheelbarrow and wheelin' her down the street
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care but - things have changed.
I hurt easy, I just don't show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and miss Lucy they jumped in a lake
I'm not that eager to make a mistake
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range

Bob Marley & The Wailers,Talkin' Blues,Reggae,"Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’
I was layin’ in bed
Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama’s homemade dress
Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough
And I was standin’ on the side of the road
Rain fallin’ on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin’ away
I heard her say over my shoulder
“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”
Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was workin’ in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I’s just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”
I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said
“You look like the silent type”
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin’ coal
Pourin’ off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I’m goin’ back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They’re an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters’ wives
Don’t know how it all got started
I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives
But me, I’m still on the road
Headin’ for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view

Damian Marley,Welcome To Jamrock,Reggae,"[Intro]
Out in the streets, they call it murder!

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Jamrock, camp where the thugs they camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell a give your girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh know this, them only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And they don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a now back too, the thugs they have do what them got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make them spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A pure tuff things come at you

When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block-off traffic
Then them wheel and pop off and them start clap it
With the pin file dung and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep and them cant stop it
Some say them a playboy (them) a playboy rabbit
Funnyman a get dropped like a bad habit
So don't bother pose off if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder!

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Jamdown, poor people are dead at random
Political violence, can't done! Pure ghost and phantom, the youth
them get blind by stardom
Now the Kings Of Kings a call
old man to Pickney, so wave one hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sicken me
Them suit no fit me, to win election they trick we
And they don't do nuttin at all

Come on let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most a the youths them waste it
And when they waste it, that's when they take the guns and replace it
Then them don't stand a chance at all
And that's why a nuff little youth have up some fat matic
With the extra magazine inna them back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who not lock glocks, them a lock rocket
Them will full you up a current like a short circuit
Them a run a roadblock which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin not stop clock it
If they run outta rounds a broke- back ratchet

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock (Southside, Northside)
Welcome to Jamrock (East Coast, West Coast, huh, yo)
Welcome to Jamrock (Conwell, Middlesex,surrey) Hey!
Welcome to Jamrock

You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks

I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
While the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatenin' my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins

How much do I know
A-to talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could?
An' I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made will never buy back your soul

An' I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I'll follow your casket
On a pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your death bed
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead",335

Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyze the stench -
To me it makes a lot of sense:
How the Dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta -
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier win the war for America

You stand up for your rights((Jah).

Mountain,Theme for an Imaginary Western,Reggae,"(Bruce,Brown)
When the wagons leave the city

Painted wagon of the morning
For the forest and futher on
Dusty roads where they´ve gone
Sometimes travelin´ through the darkness
Foreing faces by the wayside
At the summer comin´ home
Look as if they hadn´t known
And the desert that´s dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
All the sad was in their eyes

Oh the dancing and the singing
Oh the music when they play
Oh the fire that they saw there


Sometimes they found it
On the grave of no return
Sometimes they kept it
Pawnee shadow to possess him
Ofen lost in on the way
Sometimes ride inside of day
Oh the sad was in their eyes
Where the map was found
And the desert that´s dry

In a country town
And the desert that´s dry
Where the wagons boundOh the sad was in their eye
In a country town",154

I’ve got no time for school books ‘cause I got no time to study.

Hey!

You’re the type of girl that any guy would die for

So concerned with friends and your popularity
That you never even took the time to see the real me

Well now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile, I said
It always brings me back, when I hear 'OOH child!'
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I'll run the marathon to the very last mile
If you battle me, I will revile
People always say my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile
To step to me!? I'm a rapophile!

Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial

All I need is someone to tell it to, maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed, spent too freely
Every minute I have, needs to be made up, but how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say, I'm Out.
I want out.

I fall asleep with my friends around me
The only place I know I feel safe. I'm gonna call this home.
The open road is still miles away
Ain't nothin serious, we still have our fun
Oh, we had it once.
But windows open and close that's just how it goes

(Chorus) Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love forever gone?
We're only just as happy, as everyone else seems to think we are.

I'm in love with the ordinary.
I need a simple space to rest my head, and everything gets clear.
I'm a little ashamed for asking, but just a little helps
It gets me straight again, helps me get over, over it
It might seem like a dream but it's real to me
Chorus...

You should see the canals are freezing, you should see me high
You should just be here, be with me here.
It doesn't seem there's hope for me, I let you down
But I won't give in now, not for any amount.

And yesterday in Marina Del Ray

She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina Del Ray
And as we looked into each others eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina Del Ray

Like the ocean tides, highs and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina Del Ray
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed

And say hello -youï¿½re my very especial one-
But if you close the door Iï¿½d never have to see the day again

And the people on the subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain
As they stand disarrayed

Well, it's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone
It rings but it's not his voice
Seems the highway patrol has found a jackknifed rig
In a snow bank in Illinois
But the driver was missin'
And the search had been abandoned.
'Cause the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call
And she told them when they found him
To tell him that she loved him
And she hung up the phone singin'.

Chorus:
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till ya get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on.

Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
Thinkin' nothing but the worst is comin'
With the ringin' of the telephone
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening
When momma asked him to bring daddy home
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end
Askin' her if she had been singin' the song, singin'.

Chorus:
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till ya get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on (roll on)

Eighteen-wheeler
Eighteen-wheeler
Eighteen-wheeler
Eighteen-wheeler

Roll on

The Hollies,The Air That I Breathe - 2008 Remaster,Rock,"If I could make a wish
I think I'd pass
Can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read

Making love with you
Has left me peaceful, warm, and tired
What more could I ask
There's nothing left to be desired
Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe

Don Henley,The Last Worthless Evening,Rock,"I know you broke up with him
And your heart's still on the shelf
It's been over two years for me
And I'm still not quite myself
You can't be with someone new
And you can't go back to him
You're beginning to realize
That it's sink or swim

I see you around sometimes
And my heart just melts
You're lookin' like if you had your wish
You'd be somewhere else
And it just breaks my heart
To see you here this way
Someday I'll get the nerve
To walk up to you and say

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause I'll be there
When your broken heart is on the mend

Every night it's the same old crowd in smokey rooms
You catch a faint glimpse of love sometimes
But it never blooms
I've been around this block a time or two
And I've made some big mistakes
But girl I promise you, I promise you

This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance
To show you how to love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long

With the shades pulled down
God knows we could use some romance
In this sleepy bedroom town
I know you're still afraid to rush into anything
But there're just so many summers, babe
And just so many springs

And this is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend, baby
Just gimme a chance, gimme a chance
To show you love again
This is the last worthless evening
That you'll have to spend
Cause it won't be long
Til your little heart is on the mend

That you'll have to spend
Just gimme a chance, darlin
To show you how to love again

Got a ticket for my destination
On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band

Homeward bound

Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Everyday's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me

I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Silently for me

The Outlaws,Green Grass & High Tides,Rock,"In a place you only dream of
Where your soul is always free
Silver stages, golden curtains
Filled my head, plain as can be
As a rainbow grew round the sun
All the stars I've love who died
Came from somewhere beyond the scene you see
These lovely people played just for me

Now if I let you see this place
Where stories all ring true
Will you let me past your face
To see what's really you
It's not for me to ask these questions
As though I were a king
For you have to love, believe and feel
Before the burst of tamborines take you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone souls and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you


Those who don't believe me
Find your souls and set them free
Those who do, believe and love
As time will be your key
Time and time again I've thanked them
For the peace of mind
They helped me find myself
Amongst the music and the rhyme
That enchants you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone souls and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Yeah, they play just for you",219

Johnny Horton,All Grown Up,Rock,"As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation
After the US revolution cornplanter was a chief
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land
As long as the moon shall rise...
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin
It will drown the Indians graveyards cornplanter can you swim
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down
As long as the moon shall rise...
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy
As long as the moon shall rise...
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you thirsty)
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass shall grow",443

Under the Main Street light
Ridin' slow

This ol' town, ain't the same
Now nobody knows his name
Times have changed, still he rides.

Traffic lights, keepin' time
Leading the wild and restless
through the night

Still they ride, on wheels of fire
They rule the night
Still they ride, the strong will survive
Chasing thunder

Spinning 'round, in a spell
It's hard to leave this carrousel
'Round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

Cake,The Distance,Rock,"Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes; the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup

They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern

As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up, and they get out of town
The arena is empty, except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (All alone!)
All alone in her time of need

Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance
Ahh ahh

No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no line
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster truck force

In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

'Cause he's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (All alone!)
All alone in her time of need

Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course

The Guess Who,No Sugar Tonight / New Mother Nature,Rock,"Bachman)
Lonely feeling deep inside
Find a corner where I can hide
Silent footsteps crowding me
Sudden darkness but I can see

No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me

(Dat’n-doo-dow-dow-dat’n-doo-dow...)

In the silence of her mind
Quiet movements where I can find
Grabbing for me with her eyes
Now I’m falling from her skies

No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me

(Dat’n-doo-dow-dow-dat’n-doo-dow...)

Jocko says &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; and I believe him
When we talk about the things I say
She hasn’t got the faith or the guts to leave him
When they’re standing in each other’s way
You’re tripping back now to places you’ve been to
You wonder what you’re gonna find
You know you’ve been wrong but it won’t be long
Before you leave ‘em all far behind

‘Cause it’s the new Mother Nature taking over
It’s the new Splendid lady come to call
It’s the new Mother Nature taking over
She’s gettin’ us all
She’s gettin’ us all.

Jocko said &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; when I came back last time
It’s looking like I lost a friend
No use callin’ ‘cause the sky is fallin’
And I’m getting pretty near the end
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement
The situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
We’re gonna get it on right tonight

‘Cause it’s the new Mother Nature taking over
It’s the new Splendid Lady come to call
It’s the new Mother Nature taking over
She’s gettin’ us all
She’s getting’ us all...

Elvis Presley,Old Shep,Rock,"When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him Jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",210
Fleetwood Mac,Dreams,Rock,"Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat .. drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost ...
And what you had ...
You know what you lost

Oh Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know

Now Here I go again I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and ...
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of Loneliness
Like a heartbeat .. drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost ...
Who says what you had ...
Ooh and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know

Oh thunder only happens when it's raining

It's power man, power man, and all that it can bring.

You call him names and he sits and grins
'Cos everybody else is just a sucker to him.

And powerman, powerman, I'll never be your slave.

Hitler tried and Mussolini too

When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with
to grow old and never know

or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step,
and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Is a suitcase and a trunk.

Is when he's on a drunk.

Not to do what I have done,
To spend their life in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun.

And the other foot on the train,

To wear that ball and chain.

Ten Years After,I'd Love to Change the World - 2017 Remaster,Rock,"Everywhere is freaks and hairies
Dykes and fairies, tell me where is sanity
Tax the rich, feed the poor
'Til there are no rich no more

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

Population keeps on breeding
Nation bleeding, still more feeding economy
Life is funny, skies are sunny
Bees make honey, who needs money, No none for me

I'd love to change the world
But I don't know what to do
So I'll leave it up to you

O yeah

World pollution, there's no solution
Institution, electrocution
Just black and white, rich or poor
Senators stop the war

So I'll leave it up to you",132
Everclear,Strawberry - Remastered,Rock,"Never been here, never coming back
Never want to think about the things
That happened today
Want to lay down on
the warm ground
I think I'm going to need
A little time to myself

Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now

I ask you for a slow ride
Going nowhere
You look like Satan
You ask me if I want to get high
Couple of bags down in old town
You tie your arm and
Ask me if I wanted to drive

Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now

Last thing I recall
I was in the air
I woke up on the street
Crawling with my strawberry burns
Ten long years in a straight line
They fall like water
Yes, I guess I fucked up again

Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now",153

Waiting for me, wanting me to hold her oh so tightly

I need to learn the golden rule
Won't you lay it on the line?
I need to hear it just one more time

Oh won't you tell me again
Can you feel it?
Won't you tell me again
Tonight

Each and every heart it seems
Is bounded by a world of dreams

Is greeted by a lonely one

Can you feel it?
Won't you tell me again

'Cause out on the ocean of life my love
There's so many storms we must rise above
Can you hear the spirit calling
As it's carried across the waves?
You're already falling
It's calling you back to face the music
And the song that is coming through
You're already falling
The one that it's calling is you

Make a promise, take a vow
And trust your feelings; it's easy now
Understand the voice within
And feel the changes already beginning

Oh won't you tell me again
Can you feel it?
Won't you tell me again
Tonight

And how many words have I got to say
And how many times will it be this way
With your arms around the future
And your back up against the past
You're already falling, it's calling you
On to face the music
And the song that is coming through
You're already falling
The one that it's calling is you

Is bounded by a world of dreams
Each and every rising sun
Is greeted by a lonely lonely one

To steal what she never could own
And race from this hole she calls home

Now you're at the wheel
Tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalised
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellite's won

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and wails
And fills up her brigantine sails

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall",156

Well it's hard to believe I know
But I hear her singing in the sighing of the wind
Blowin' in the tree tops way above me

Yes I'll always remember
Till the day I die
I'll hear her cry
Johnny remember me

Well some day I guess
I'll find myself another little girl
To take the place of my true love
But as long as I live I know
I'll hear her singing in the sighing of the wind
Blowin' in the tree tops way above me

Yes I'll always remember
Till the day I die
I'll hear her cry

Billy Ocean,"Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car",Rock,"In the middle of the night

I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To the river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That is running to the promise land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night

Better run, girl,

You led me to believe
You're old enough
To give me Love
And now it hurts to know the truth, Oh,

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl,
You're much too young, girl

Beneath your perfume and make-up
You're just a baby in disguise
And though you know
That it is wrong to be
Alone with me
That come on look is in your eyes, Oh,

Young girl, get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl,
You're much too young, girl

I'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out of here

To change my mind

Simon & Garfunkel,The Dangling Conversation,Rock,"It's a still life watercolor
Of a now late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtain lace
And shadows wash the room

And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar

In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickenson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost

Like a poem poorly written
We are persons out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time

And the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
Can analysis be worthwhile
Is the theatre really dead

And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow
I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me

Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives",174
Soul Asylum,Runaway Train,Rock,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Chorus
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

CHORUS

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like the madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

CHORUS

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same",238
