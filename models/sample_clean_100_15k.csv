Memphis Minnie,He's In the Ring (Doin' the Same Old Thing),Blues,"If Simon says be glad today
I surely do what Simon say
And if youl like to see me smile
Then you're in luck cause that's my style

My pretty bird up in the tree
I hear the song you sing for me
The sky's fantastic blue or grey
And here we are alive today

Hey...
The simple things
The lovely simple things
The sunset and the dawn
The simple things
The lovely simple things
I could go on and on and on

For the simple pleasures
Are worth more than treasures
That your paper money ever bring

This song is old, this song is new
This song is me, this song is you
I like to play out in the rain
I like the sun to shine again
And again and again

Each day so many things to see
And I'm so glad I am me
And you, my friends, are pretty too
And I'm so glad that you are you",162,32
The Supremes,Where Did Our Love Go,Blues,"(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.)

Ooh baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay
Need ya, need ya

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we seperate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do
I get this need

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away

Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me

I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

Brother, brother, brother

Stevie Wonder,I Wish,Blues,"Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""

Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go?
Cause I love them so

Doo Do Doo...

Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world

Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ev-er have to go?",250,45
Otis Redding,(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay,Blues,"Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch them roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
Cuz I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothing's gonna come my way

So, I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, listen

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home, now

I'm just gon' sit at the dock of a bay
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay

Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper

I close my eyes, Then I drift away
Into the magic night. I softly say
A silent prayerLike dreamers do.
Then I fall asleep to dream My dreams of you.

In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you.
In dreams you're mine. All of the time we're together
In dreams, In dreams.

But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone.
I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry.
I remember that you said goodbye.

It's too bad that all these things, Can only happen in my dreams
Only in dreams In beautiful dreams.",130,20

Over a brown-eyed handsome man,
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Between a doctor and a lawyer man.
Her mother told her, ""Daughter go out and find yourself
A brown-eyed handsome man,
Just like your daddy was, a brown-eyed handsome man.""

other fellas never, never ring her phone
she let's them know just where they stand
she tells them all that i'm her man
and when we're out on a date
all the fellas wait till i walk away
they try to beat my time
she tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine

You can see Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue lights.
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball.
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.

Well, now momma, poppa told me: ""Son, you better watch your step.""
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my dad myself.


Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball.
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call.

I am going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring.
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen carat golden thing.

I Put My Root Down

It's Not A Put Down

Everbody Knows I'm Known For Dropping Science
I'm Electric Like Dick Hyman
I Guess You'd Expect To Catch The Crew Rhymin'
Never Let You Down With The Stereo Sound
So Mike, Get On The Mic And Turn It Out
We're Talking Root Down, I Put My Root Down
And If You Want To Battle Me, You're Putting Loot Down
I Said Root Down, It's Time To Scoot Down
I'm A Step Up To The Mic In My Goose Down
Come Up Representing From The Upper West
Money Makin' Putting Me To The Test
Sometimes I Feel As Though I've Been Blessed
Because I'm Doing What I Want So I Never Rest
Well, I'm Not Coming Out Goofy Like The Fruit Of The Loom Guys
Just Strutting Like The Meters With The Look-ka Py Py
'Cause Downtown Brooklyn Is Where I Was Born
but When The Snow Is Falling, Then I'm Gone
You Might Think That I'm A Fanatic
A Phone Call From Utah And I'm Throwing A Panic
But We Kick It From The Root When We Break It On Down
Jimmy Smith Is My Man, I Want To Give Him A Pound

(Chorus)

Ad Rock Don't Stop, Get On The Mic With The Tic And The Toc
I'll Fill You With The Fuckin' Rim Like Brim
I'm Walking Down Your Block And You Say That's Him
There Goes The Guy With The Funky Sound
The Beastie Boys You Know We Come To Get Down
Because I've Got The Flow Where I Grab My Dick
And Say Oh My God, That's The Funky Shit
So I'm Going To Pass The Mic And Cause A Panic
The Original Nasal Kid Is Doing Damage
Every Morning I Took The Train To High Street Station
Doing Homework On The Train, What A Fucked Up situation
On The Way Back Up Hearing Battle Tapes
Through The Underground, Underneath The Sky Scrapes
Like Harlem World Battles On The Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe D Vs. Busy Bee There's One You Should Know
Enough Of That, I Just Want To Give Some Respect Due
M.C.A. Grab The Mic And The Ma Bell Will Connect You
Bob Marley Was A Prophet For The Freedom Fight
""If Dancin' Prays To The Lord Then I Shall Feel Alright""
It Feels To Play A Little Music
Tears Running Down My Face 'Cause I Love To Do It
And No One Can Stop This Flow From Flowing On
A Flow Master In Disaster With A Sound That's Gone
I'll Give A Little Shout Out To My Dad And Mom
For Bringing Me Into This World And So On

Carole King,So Far Away,Blues,"So far away, doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away

Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could, but you're so far away

One more song about movin' along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it bein' close to you.

But you're so far away, doesn't anybody stay in one place any more
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away

Travelin' around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothin' else to do but close my mind
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams
I've yet to find

But your so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away...",193,27

As I step down from the train,
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me,
Arm reachin' smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing,
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize yes, I was only dreamin'
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me beneath the green, green grass of home",195,28
Amy Winehouse,You Know I'm No Good,Blues,"Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do it with him today?""
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy, He’s in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes, This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and Pita; You say ""When we're married"" cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more, I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain; We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, You on the seat; Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice little carpet burn, My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst to truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
I cheated myself, like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, yeah, You know that I'm no good",236,31

Watching the evening show.

About some things that Anthony told
Her over the telephone.

That I had told her not to tell;

We've definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?
Isn't that nice?
I mean really when you really sit and think about it
isn't it really really nice?
I can easily feel myself sliping in more and more ways
in a simple world of my own
Nobody but you ... and me
We got it together babe

My first, my last, my everything.
And the answer to all my dreams.
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star.
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you.
There's no way, they could have made two
You're all I'm living for,
Your love I'll keep for evermore,
You're the first, you're the last, my everything.

In you I've found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
Can't you see if you,
You'll make me feel this way.
You're like a first morning dew on a brand new day.

I see so many way that I can love you,
Till the day I die.
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream.
You're the first, the last, my everything

Percy Sledge,Take Time to Know Her,Blues,"I found a woman
I felt I truely loved
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

I took her home to mama
Mama wanted to see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said, son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fhing
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing

But I didn't listen to mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait to have a little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and then he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Its not an overnight fling
You better take time to know her
Please Please don't rush into this thing

When it look like every thing was gonna turn out all right
And then I came home a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand
And said son, take time to know her
Its not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing
Take time to know her
Its not an overnight fling

There you were, I fell on the floor

I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin� in my eyes

I know I had to hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time

I've got to make sure you don't get away
After all you done, girl, to make me wanna stay

All my life I've been searchin� for a star
Now my search is over and here we are
Livin� in ecstasy, yeah, when you lay down next to me, yeah
Here in ecstasy, when you're layin� down next to me

I wanna hold you and make you mine

You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone

You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you, oh
You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover you

All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
Don't pass me by
I wanna get your love all ready for the chain reaction ...",330,47

Travis Tritt,It's A Great Day To Be Alive,Country,"I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's been 15 years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in teh mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive


I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

Sometimes it lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good",311,54
Johnny Cash,Understand Your Man - Stereo Version,Country,"Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black.",311,39

Deana Carter,Strawberry Wine,Country,"He was working through college on my grandpa's farm.
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car. (yeah)
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child.
When one restless summer we found love growing wild.
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path.
It's funny how those memories they last.
Like strawberry wine and seventeen.
The hot July moon saw everything.
My first taste of love oh bittersweet.
The green on the vine.
Like strawberry wine.

I still remember when thirty was old.
My biggest fear was September when he had to go.
A few cards and letters and one long distance call.
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall.
But year after year I come back to this place.
Just to remember the taste.
Of strawberry wine and seventeen.
The hot July moon saw everything.
My first taste of love oh bittersweet.
The green on the vine.
Like strawberry wine.

The fields have grown over now.
Years since they've seen the plow.
There's nothing time hasn't touched.
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence.
I've been missing so much.... yeaaaaaa

Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye

She visits my grave when the night winds wail

Nobody knows but me

David Allan Coe,Longhaired Redneck,Country,"Country DJ's knows that I'm an outlaw
They'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys
Who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get outta here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's gettin' to me
Talking 'bout my earrings and my hair
I guess he ain't read the signs that say I been to prison
Someone ought to warn him 'fore I knock him off his chair

Cause my longhair just can't cover up my red neck
I've won every fight I've ever fought
Hey I don't need some turkey telling me that I ain't country
And sayin' I ain't worth the damned ol' ticket that he bought

Cause I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
They tell me I look like Merle Haggard
And sound a lot like David Allen Coe

And the bar maid in the last town that we played in
Knew the words to every song I'd wrote
She said Jimmy Rabbit turned her on to my last album
Just about the time the jukebox broke
Yeah Johhny Cash helped me get out of prison
Long before Rodriguez stole that goat
I've been the Rhinestone Cowboy for so long I can't remember
And I can do you every song Hank Williams ever wrote

Cause I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
I can't help it, I look like Merle Haggard
And I sound a lot like David Allen Coe

But the country DJ's all think I'm an outlaw
And they'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys
Who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive

Lefty Frizzell,Look What Thoughts Will Do,Country,"Once I thought I loved just you
And I thought you loved me too
But just look what thoughts will do
For today you say we're through

Now another wears the crown
And you think that you have found
Just what makes your world go 'round
Watch those thoughts, they'll get you down

If, within your future years
Your new love should bring you tears
Then you'll think of me I'm sure
But those thoughts won't help you dear

Thought I'd build a home for two
Just a home for me and you
Thought we'd have some kiddies too
But just look what thoughts will do

Now, I know just how you feel
That your love was never real
Guess to you I don't appeal
So we'll just forget the deal

So, goodbye and here's to you
And I'm happy through and through
Yes, you thought that I'd be blue
But just look what thoughts will do",157,29

The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the grand ole opry
Is calling me back to my smoky mountain home
I wish I had my old fishin� pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Since the big apple took a bite out of me
And lord, I'm so tennessee homesick that I could die

But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed

What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of mama�s homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues running through my head

Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And take off to calhoun country and catch us a coon

Go to church on sunday with dinner on the grounds

Jewel,Foolish Games,Country,"You took your coat off
And stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside
Looking in on you

You were always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair, you were
Fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway
With nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart, bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These... foolish games are
Tearing me apart
And your, thoughtless words...
Are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes
And talking over coffee
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart
And you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

Teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands
Behind my back
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you

Excuse me
Think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself
And these... foolish games... are
Tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart...
And your
Thoughtless words...
Are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

Stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that",249,54
Alan Jackson,Midnight In Montgomery,Country,"'Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit and haunting haunted eyes
He said 'Friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone
Was he ever really there

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
When the wind is right, you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

I climbed back on my eagle
Took one last look around
Through red tail lights
The shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I could hear that whistle moan
I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind it's right, you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery

He's always singing there
Hank's always singing there'",235,37
Tim McGraw,My Best Friend,Country,"My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I wouldn't trade them for gold
Cause they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
Their woven in the stories I have told
And tell again

My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There's always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

Don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why

My old friend, this song's for you
Cause a few a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Cause the love and the laughter
Will live long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We'll meet again, my old friend

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye",163,34

Tim McGraw,Red Ragtop,Country,"I was twenty and she was eighteen,
We were just about as wild as we were green,
In the ways of the world.
Well she picked me up in that red rag top,
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops,
On a summer night, running all the red lights.

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal burning stove.
We were cooking with gas
knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be, for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school,
And life was fast and the world was cruel,
We were young and wild, we decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets in the morning light,
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end,
No I can't say where she is today,
I can't remember who I was back then.

Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins,
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time, drive you outta� your mind.
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday,
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet and her eyes were green,
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me (2x)",308,43
Johnny Cash,"Jackson - Live at Folsom State Prison, Folsom, CA - January 1968",Country,"I hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....",176,21

-Sold over a million copies
-A ""novelty"" song
-Produced by Boomer Castleman and Jim Rutledge of ""Bloodrock""

I went to my apartment on a Monday at one
A-singin' do lolly, lolly shicky bum, shicky bum
Started movin' in it on a Tuesday at two
A-singin' do lolly, lolly shicky do, shicky do
Wednesday at three I called the phone company, singin':
""Hey baby, put a phone in for me""
Thursday at four he came a-knockin' at my door, singin':

""Hey, baby, I'm your telephone man
You just show me where you want it and I'll put it where I can
I can put it in the bedroom, I can put it in the hall
I can put it in the bathroom, I can hang it on the wall
You can have it with a buzz, you can have it with a ring
And if you really want it you can have a ding-a-ling
Because-a hey baby, I'm your telephone man""

Can you believe that? And then he says:

""Now when other fellas call ya tell 'em how it all began""

Well...can you imagine?

My heart began a-thumpin' and my mind began to fly
And I knew I wasn't dealin' with no ordinary guy
So while he was a-talking I was thinkin' up my plan
Then my fingers did the walkin' on the telephone man

Singin' hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Get it any way you can
Right? Ha ha ha, so...

I got it in the bedroom, and I got it in the hall
And I got it in the bathroom, and he hung it on the wall
I got it with a buzz, and I got it with a ring
And when he told me what my number was I got a ding-a-ling

A-singin' hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Just-a doin' my thing

Ha, ha...I've never done anything like this before!

If it's getting harder to face every day
Don't let it show, don't let it show
Though it's getting harder to take what they say
Just let it go, just let it go

And if it hurts when they mention my name
Say you don't know me
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame
Say you don't own me

Even if it's taking the easy way out
Keep it inside of you
Don't give in
Don't tell them anything
Don't let it
Don't let it show

Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say
Say you don't care, say you don't care
Even if you want to believe there's a way
I won't be there, I won't be there

But if you smile when they mention my name
They'll never know you
And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame
They'll never own you

Can't you feel the love that I send you
I surrender.

I remember, seems like a lifetime
Can't believe it's a matter of days
Since you left me I'm near to heartbreak
I want you so bad don't turn away
What does it take to stay by my side
You know I'll do what you want me to
Don't take away this feeling inside
I'm still in love with you

I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender

Can't you feel the love that I send you
I surrender.

You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You know just what i was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone i really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when i looked to the moon it turned to gold

Blue moon
Now i'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough; dump my blues down in the gulf.
She loves you, Big River, more than me.

And greet the angels in their hive

Sometimes I wish I were you

And all the sweet honey from above

Pour it all over me sweet love

And while you`re flying around my head

Your honey kisses keep me fed

I wish I had your pair of wings

I was lost in paradise

Wish i`d never opened my eyes

I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dress like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son

Well I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride

Well he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said this is where you get off boy
I'm goin' back to Alabam
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said mister many thanks
He said you don't have to call me mister mister
The whole world calls me Hank

Johnny Cash,"Sunday Morning Coming Down - Live at Ryman Auditorium, Nashville, TN - July 1970",Country,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking.
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking.
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken.
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging.
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing.
Then I headed down the street,
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.

David Allan Coe,You Never Even Called Me By My Name,Country,"It was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
Even though your on my fightin' side.

CHORUS
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain.
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
I've seen it on signs where I've laid
But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.

CHORUS...

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
and he told me it was the perfect country and western song.
I wrote him back a letter and told him it was NOT the perfect
country and western song because he hadn't said anything about
Momma, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk.

Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent
it to me and after reading it, I realized that my friend had written
the perfect country and western song. And I felt obliged to include it
on this album.

The last verse goes like this here:

Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
And I went to pick her up in the rain.
But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train.

CHORUS
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain. No,
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name.",342,47

"Hank Williams, Jr.",All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,Country,"All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And ol' George Jones I'm glad to see is finally gettin' straight
And Waylon's stayin' home and lovin' Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And cornbread and ice tea's took the place of pills and ninety proof

Johnny Cash,The Wreck of the Old 97,Country,"I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sittin' there.
I said, ""Your old court house is kinda run down,
He said, ""Naw, it'll do for our little town"".
I said, ""Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit,
And that's a ragged old flag you got hangin' on it"".
He said, ""Have a seat"", and I sat down,
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town""
I said, ""I think it is""
He said ""I don't like to brag, but we're kinda proud of
That Ragged Old Flag

""You see, we got a little hole in that flag there,
When Washington took it across the Delaware.
and It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it,
writing ""Say Can You See""
It got a bad rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
tugging at its seams.
and It almost fell at the Alamo
beside the Texas flag,
But she waved on though.
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville,
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill.
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg,
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag

""On Flanders Field in World War I,
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun,
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two,
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
by her Uncle Sam.
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
and now they've about quit wavin' back here at home
in her own good land here She's been abused,
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused,
And the government for which she stands
Has scandalized throughout out the land.
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearin' thin,
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in.
Cause she's been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more.

""So we raise her up every morning
And we take her down every night,
We don't let her touch the ground,
And we fold her up right.
On second thought
I *do* like to brag
Cause I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag""",380,52

""She's My Kind Of Rain""

She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

She sits quietly there
Like water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

Oh, rain on me

Willie Nelson,Stardust,Country,"Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night
dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

So when I make a big mistake

I will cry those teardrops knowin'
I will be just fine

Did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't I see
I'd best be leaving well enough alone

Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
They keep a-haunting me in memories
There's one in every crowd, for crying out loud
Why was it always turning out to be me

Chorus:
Where does it go, the good Lord only knows
Seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay

Piano rolled blues, I danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For loveable losers, and no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

Alan Jackson,Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,Country,"Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
I'd really ever take it this far
Singin� in the bars

CHORUS:
And chasin� that neon rainbow
Livin� that honky tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin� that neon rainbow
Livin� that honky tonk dream

And it was at a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
Headin� down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowd�s into it, lord,
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

CHORUS

Now daddy�s got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said; son I just know
We're gonna hear you singin� on it some day
I made it up to music row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My dad was a poor, hard-working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay

I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me ""that son of a Saginaw fisherman""
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand

Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool, I'm a-diggin' in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich, and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said, honey I'm a-coming home, please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history

Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, ""son, you wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim""

Now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him

Johnny Cash,Don't Take Your Guns to Town,Country,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",305,53

I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time everytime
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever
Every little thing that you do

"Hank Williams, Jr.",Feelin' Better,Country,"Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain

Give me endless summer
Lord I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old
Before my time

As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man

Go easy on my conscience
Cause it's not my fault
I know I've been taught
To take the blame

Rest assured my angels
Who catch my tears
Walk me out of here
I'm in pain

As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man

Once you've found that lover
You're homeward bound
Love is all around
Love is all around

I know some have fallen
On stony ground
But love is all around

Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain

Give me endless summer
Lord I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old
Before my time

As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man",203,53
David Allan Coe,You Never Even Called Me By My Name,Country,"It was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
Even though your on my fightin' side.

CHORUS
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain.
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
I've seen it on signs where I've laid
But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.

CHORUS...

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
and he told me it was the perfect country and western song.
I wrote him back a letter and told him it was NOT the perfect
country and western song because he hadn't said anything about
Momma, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk.

Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent
it to me and after reading it, I realized that my friend had written
the perfect country and western song. And I felt obliged to include it
on this album.

The last verse goes like this here:

Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
And I went to pick her up in the rain.
But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train.

CHORUS
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain. No,
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name.",342,47

Years & Years,King,Electronic,"The death of a king,
Alluring lassos slide on so smooth
Tissue made of razors,
Dragging across you.

The flushing of eyes,
Couldn't cleanse your abrasions,
Deep inside consumed with guilt,
I'm clothed in a bed of blankouts,
Dream suspicious strangers over night.

Righteous pharisees befriending,
Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness.

Briding a widow in spite of her venom,
I've failed to mention your soul,
Three becoming two.

Such a left in criminal,
Only the mind of the temptress knows,
Actions are my remorse for amnesia.

Righteous pharisees befriending,
Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness.

So close to healing the weak,
Turning into the enemy,
Paralyzing kings.

Righteous pharisees befriending,
Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness.",142,35

Wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge of witness
Means that I believed

Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home

They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
She took me down and said:
""Boys like you are overrated, so save your breath""
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you

Fails to mention I still hate you

Until your breathing stops forever, forever

Duran Duran,Save a Prayer - 2009 Remaster,Electronic,"You saw me standing by the wall,
Corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun,
So you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go

Don't say a prayer for me now,
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now,
Save it 'til the morning after

Look you down into the well
If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance

You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

Don't say a prayer for me now,
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now,
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after,
Save it till the morning after

I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise,
Melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand
But we can call it paradise

Don't say a prayer for me now,
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now,

Tell those men with horses for hearts
That their jibes don't make me bleed

To celebrate the fact

Seem like paradise
To someone like

I want to take you
In my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

Sade,Smooth Operator - Single Version,Electronic,"Diamond life, lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste
And maximum joy
City lights, business nights
When you require streetcar desire
For higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south to Key Largo
Love for sale

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories
And change into gold
His eyes are like angels but
His heart is cold

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator

A Flock Of Seagulls,Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You),Electronic,"It's not the way you look,
It's not the way that you smile.
Although there's something to them.
It's not the way you have your hair,
It's not that certain style;
It could be that with you.

If I had a photograph of you,
It's something to remind me.
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing.

It's not the make-up
And it's not the way that you dance,
It's not the evening sky.
It's more the way your eyes
are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide.

If I had a photograph of you,
It's something to remind me.
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing.

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do
It must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long
Tell me is it all for nothing
Just don't walk out the door.

If I had a photograph of you,
It's something to remind me.
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing.

There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us

Who wants to live forever?

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Who dares to love forever?
When love must die

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Build your muscles as your body decays

Toe your line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name

For your truth it's all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all

Face to faces, secret places, feel the chill

Night fall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas,
Could it be the whole lot opening wide
A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
A week is why

Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assasination standing still

First crystal tears,
Fallen of snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench you skin of lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

When all we see is the view to a kill",185,38

With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny
I said it again
Could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait till you decide
Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time La Luna

I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

Breaking away with the best of both worlds
A smile that you can't disguise
Every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind
Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna

New moon on Monday
And a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite",162,30

Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning weak
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done
So I missed a million miles of fun

My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap

Involved an under usual feat

So be careful and be kind

Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

Somebody already broke my heart

Queen,It's Late - Remastered 2011,Electronic,"You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late - but it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryin' to work it out
I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

Too late much too late
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life alright?

It's late - but it's time to set me free
It's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late it's late it's late it's late
It's late it's late
It's all too late",378,60

You break the law and you preach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money - and you want more!

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heart...of your own

Kill-joy, Bad guy,
Big-talking small fry
You're just an old barrow-boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me?

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good, are you satisfied

Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night
Do you feel good - Feel good!

Talk like a big business tycoon,
But you're just a hot-air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school-boy
Let me tan your hide.

A dog with disease,
You're the King of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know-all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal...shark!

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own,
(You never did, right from the start)

Insane, you should be put inside,
You're a sewer-rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null-and-void,
Make me feel good
I feel good!",246,52

Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

When I fell it was awful nice
Caught when not suspecting vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

Blasted by your booby traps
I felt the blow in both knee-caps
Your eyes did shine
Your lips were fine
And the device in your pants was out of site

All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love

If I should find a helping hand

Does anybody know what we are living for
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on - yeah
Ooh inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Yeah, oh oh oh

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends

The show must go on - yeah
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on

Howard Jones,Everlasting Love,Electronic,"He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.

I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.

(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.

(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...

(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd verse, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th verse ''I went to see my
friend today may be found saying ''I went to see him just today'')",238,42

Warren Zevon,Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner - 2007 Remaster,Folk,"Written By Warren Zevon &amp; David Lindell c. 1976 Zevon Music/BMI

Roland was a warrior from the Land of the Midnight Sun
With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done
The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day
So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray

Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war
With their fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore
For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees
They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese

Roland the Thompson gunner...

His comrades fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest
But of all the Thompson gunners, Roland was the best
So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead
That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland's head

Roland the headless Thompson gunner
Norway's bravest son
Time, time, time
For another peaceful war
But time stands still for Roland
'Til he evens up the score
They can still see his headless body stalking through the night
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun
In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun

Roland searched the continent for the man who'd done him in
He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin
Roland aimed his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word
But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg

Roland the headless Thompson gunner...

The eternal Thompson gunner
still wandering through the night
Now it's ten years later but he still keeps up the fight
In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine and Berkeley
Patty Hearst heard the burst of Roland's Thompson gun and bought it",279,41

Emmylou Harris,The Boxer - 2002 Remaster,Folk,"(Paul Simon)

I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

Well, I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy in the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Li li li li...

Only seeking workman's wages
I come looking for a job but I get no offers
Just a come on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when
I was so lonesome I took some comfort there
In a laying out my winter clothes and wishing
I was home going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me, bleeding me, going home.
Da da da da...

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out in his danger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving but the fighter still remains.

Well, won't you lend your lungs to me?
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing.
Breath I'll take and breath I'll give
Pray the day ain't poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision.

Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool, it's only moonlight.
If you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another.



Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at it's mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers

And love his only concept

And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one, and you for two

And now the gravity of trouble was more than I could bear,
At times my luck was so bad, I had to fold my hands,
Almost lost my soul, rarely I could find my head,
Wake up early in the morning, feeling nearly dead.

I was never afraid of danger, took trouble on the chin,
Mountains I have climbed, that have killed a thousand men,
Spent most of my lifetime downtown, sleepin' behind the wheel,
Never needed anybody, I was king of the hill.

[Chorus:]
Oh, when I think about the old days,
Lord, it sends chills up and down my spine,
Yeah life ain't what it seems, on the boulevard of broken dreams,
Guess I opened my eyes in the nick of time,
'Cause it sure felt like the end of the line.

No matter how hard I run, I just can't get away
I try to do my best, but the devil gets in my way
Spent most of my lifetime downtown, sleepin' behind the wheel
'Till it all came down to kill or be killed

[Chorus]",199,27
Scott McKenzie,San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair),Folk,"If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet some gentle people there

For those who come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there
In the streets of San Francisco
Gentle people with flowers in their hair

All across the nation such a strange vibration
People in motion
There's a whole generation with a new explanation
People in motion people in motion

For those who come to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there

If you come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there",119,22
Keane,Somewhere Only We Know,Folk,"I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know?
Somewhere only we know?

Lee Hazlewood,Wait Till Next Year,Folk,"There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all

Catching in my eye
Like a bird sea-goin'

You're away from here...

A bunch of friends are missing
From this tapestry
I remember kissing
Do you remember me

It happens each day
You're away from here...

Like a disembodied spirit
Watching over me
Like a sister sailing ship
Dead against the sea

It happens each day
You're away from here...",74,23

With this feeling inside me, that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried, been carried away, away

But I know it's amazing, can save me my time is coming
I'll find my way out

While there's light at the end of the tunnel
I'll keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break

Mississippi John Hurt,Praying On the Old Camp Ground,Folk,"This old guitar taught me to sing a lovesong,
showed me how to laugh and how to cry,
introduced me to some friends of mine,
and brightened up some days,
it helped me make it through some lonely nights,
oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night.

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady,
it opened up her eyes and ears to me,
it brought us close together,
I guess it broke her heart,
but it opened up the space for us to be,
what a lovely place, a lovely space to be.

This old guitar gave me my life my living,
and all the things I know I love to do,
to serenade the stars that shine
from a sunny mountain side,
most of all to sing my songs for you,
ooh, I love to sing my songs for you,
yes I do,Lord, I love to sing my songs for you.",156,21
Old & In The Way,Wild Horses,Folk,"Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I bought them for you

You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away,
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer, a dull, aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away,
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie,
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried,
Let's do some living after we die

Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

Year of nineteen hundred and twelve, April the fourteenth day
Great Titanic struck an iceberg, people had to run and pray

The guards who had been a-watching, asleep 'cause they were tired
When they heard the great excitement, then a gunshot was fired
God moves, moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
Captain Smith gave orders, women and children first
Many of the lifeboats piled right up, many were liable to crush
God moves on, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
Ahh-ah
So many had to leave their happy home, all that they possess
Lord Jesus, will you hear us now, help us in our distress
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, people had to run and pray
Women had to leave their loving ones, see 'bout their safety
When they heard the liner was doomed, hearts did almost break
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
A.G. Smith, mighty man, built a boat that he couldn't understand
Named it a name of God in a tin, without a ""c"", Lord, he pulled it in

Joni Mitchell,The Dawntreader,Folk,"Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions

Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbor wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his seadreams come to me

City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his seadreams come to me

Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his seadreams come to me",263,40

Do you believe in youth
The history of all truth
A heart that's left at home
Becomes a heart of stone

Do you believe in truth?
The lies we told of youth
A cause we call our own
Beside an empty throne
How many times before
Could you tell I didn't care?

And you knew I wasn't there

Just like your sordid home
How many times before
Did you leave my soul alone?",129,25

That you're out of time to swim ashore

And all that tension between his gears, man, he never ever leave this place

Aw, man, that can make you real real slow
And if heaven were below, you'd know just where to go
Dive in the ocean and he'd sink like a stone
And he said, it's time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough I'll be home

Rosanne Cash,Tennessee Flat Top Box,Folk,"In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: &amp;quot;Don't stop.&amp;quot;
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)",199,26

Loretta Lynn,You Ain't Woman Enough,Folk,"You've come to tell me somethin'
You say I ought to know
That he don't love me any more
And I'll have to let him go

You say you're gonna take him
But I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough
To take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him
I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here

It'll be over my dead body
So get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enought
To take my man

(Instrumental)

Sometimes a man's caught lookin'
At things that he don't need
He took a second look at you
But he's in love with me
Well, I don't know where that leaves you
Ah, but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough
To take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him
I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here

It'll be over my dead body
So get out while you can

No, you ain't woman enough

The Byrds,5D (Fifth Dimension),Folk,"Oh how is it
That I could come out to you
And be still floatin'
And never hit bottom
But keep falling through
Just relaxing and paying attention

All my two-dimensional
Boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw that world crumble
And thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working

And as I continued
To drop through the hole
I found all surrounding
To show me that joy innocently is


Just be quiet and feel it around you

And I opened my heart
To the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder
My teachers had made
Scientific delerium madness

I will keep falling as long as I live
Ah, without ending
And I will remember
The place that is now
That has ended
Before the beginning

{Repeat 1st verse}",143,37
Burl Ives,The Little Drummer Boy,Folk,"(Hank Cochran)

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.

You said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow, that I'd laugh when you walked away.

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go.

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your *grip* through the door.
A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down.

A little bitty tear let me down.",214,28
John Prine,Illegal Smile,Folk,"©1971 by John Prine

When I woke up this morning, things were lookin' bad
Seem like total silence was the only friend I had
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized
That I was havin' ... no fun

Chorus:
But fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun

Last time I checked my bankroll,
It was gettin' thin
Sometimes it seems like the bottom
Is the only place I've been
I Chased a rainbow down a one-way street... dead end
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen

Repeat Chorus:

Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls
Tryin' to get away
From all the ears inside my walls
I dreamed the police heard
Everything I thought... what then?
Well I went to court
And the judge's name was Hoffman

Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun
Well done, hot dog bun, my sister's a nun",245,38

You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby... I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralysed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam some 1oo times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Oh Ruby.. For god's sake turn around",226,31
Harry Chapin,Cat's in the Cradle,Folk,"My child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay.
He learned to walk while I was away.
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, dad.
You know I'm gonna be like you.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

My son turned ten just the other day.
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today,
I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's ok.""
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed,
Said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I'm gonna be like him.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, he came from college just the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
""Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile,
""What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later. Can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

I've long since retired and my son's moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu,
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad.
It's been sure nice talking to you.""
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like me.
My boy was just like me.

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
We're gonna have a good time then.""",438,57

''In recent times, there is no one at all who can approach
''Antonio Gaudi''. He started a new cathedral, in Barcelona,
it is called'' La Sagrada Familia ''or the'' Holy Family...
''The sad thing is they could try to finish it, but I don't
think they will do it.''

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll meet along the way
Follow the brightest star as far as the brave may dare
What will we find when we get there

La Sagrada Familia we pray the storm will soon be over
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb

Who knows where the winds may blow us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll ever reach the shore
Follow a rising sun with eyes that may only stare
What kind of fire will burn us there? What kind of fire?
Only a fool would say

La Sagrada Familia the wind has changed the storm is over
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the danger's over
La Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land

Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears

Who knows where the world may turn us, only a fool would say
Who knows what the fates may have in store
Follow the light of truth as far as our eyes can see
How should we know where that may be? How should we know?

Then the angry skies, the battle cries, the sounds of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows what's been lost along the way
Look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share
How will we know when we are there? How will we know?
Only a fool would say

La Sagrada Familia the war is won the battle's over
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the danger's over
La Sagrada Familia behold the mighty hand
La Sagrada Familia the night is gone the waiting's over
La Sagrada Familia there's peace throughout the land

Until the next time
Until the next time

"Peter, Paul and Mary","Puff, the Magic Dragon",Folk,"Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,

And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. Oh

And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.

Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail,
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came,
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name. Oh!

Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.

A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.

His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave,
So Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. Oh!

Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, Always knew what's goin on
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's done, been lazin' out in the noonday sun

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dress down

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae (?)
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her runnin' around

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done

All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

John Prine,Donald and Lydia,Folk,"Small town, bright lights, Saturday night -
Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of Virginia and Ray.

Lydia!

Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat -
Behind her small eyes, sunk deep in her fat.
She read romance magazines up in her room,
And felt just like Sunday on Saturday afternoon.

Chorus:

But dreamin' just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feedin' daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heart

Bunk beds, shaved heads, Saturday night -
A warehouse of strangers 'neath 60-watt lights.
Starin' through the ceiling, just wanting to be,
Lay one of too many, a young P.F.C.

Donald!

There were spaces between Donald...
And whatever he said.
Strangers had forced him
To live in his head.
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks' latrines.

(Chorus)

Hot love, cold love, no love at all
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall
Nothin' is wrong, nothin' is right,
Donald and Lydia
Made love that night.

Love!

They made love in the mountains,
They made love in the streams,
They made love in the valleys,
They made love in their dreams.
But when they was finished,
There was nothin' to say -
Cause mostly they made love
Ten miles away.

goodbye dry eyes I watched your plane fade off west of the moon

no regrets
no tears goodbye
don't want you back
we'd only cry again
say goodbye again

the hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
not thinkin' you were gone
it felt so strange to lie awake alone

no regrets
no tears goodbye
don't want you back
we'd only cry again
say goodbye again

our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
strange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away
just beyond the darkest hour, just behind the dawn

say goodbye again",166,33

And the old Australian crawl

This summer I swam in a public place
And a reservoir to boot
At the latter I was informal
At the former I wore my suit
I wore my swimming suit

Gordon Lightfoot,Crossroads,Folk,"When first I did appear upon this native soil
All up and down this country at labor I did toil
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea
The people said Who are you and what would your name be
I said I have no home and I am no man's son
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done

So I swung an axe as a timberjack
And I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds

I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done

But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time",300,35

The Byrds,Chimes of Freedom,Folk,"Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts, struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors, whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashed
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail
For the lonesome hearted lovers, with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
And we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, srung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",230,26

else, under the impression that he was a deer with a red hat
perhaps, maybe a large flesh-colored squirrel. At any rate,
it seems to me that this marks an encouraging new trend in the
field of blood sports, and deserves a new type of hunting song
which I present herewith:''

I always will remember,
'Twas a year ago November,
I went out to hunt some deer
On a mornin' bright and clear.
I went and shot the maximum the game laws would allow,
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow.

I was in no mood to trifle,
I took down my trusty rifle
And went out to stalk my prey.
What a haul I made that day.
I tied them to my fender, and I drove them home somehow,
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow.

The law was very firm, it
Took away my permit,
The worst punishment I ever endured.
It turned out there was a reason,
Cows were out of season,
And one of the hunters wasn't insured.

People ask me how I do it,
And I say, „There's nothin' to it,
You just stand there lookin' cute,
And when something moves, you shoot!“
And there's ten stuffed heads in my trophy room right now,
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a pure-bred Guernsey cow.",252,36
Joni Mitchell,"Night In The City - Live at The 2nd Fret, Philadelphia, PA, 11/1966",Folk,"It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mothers' home
She went to Florida and left you
With you father`s gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be

I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
ON the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be

You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see, who in the world you might be",144,24
Richie Havens,Follow,Folk,"Let the river rock you like a cradle
Climb to the treetops, child, if you're able
Let your hands tie a knot across the table.
Come and touch the things you cannot feel.

And close your fingertips and fly where I can't hold you
Let the sun-rain fall and let the dewy clouds enfold you
And maybe you can sing to me the words I just told you,
If all the things you feel ain't what they seem.
And don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream.

The mocking bird sings each different song
Each song has wings - they won't stay long.
Do those who hear think he's doing wrong?
While the church bell tolls its one-note song
And the school bell is tinkling to the throng.
Come here where your ears cannot hear.

And close your eyes, child, and listen to what I'll tell you
Follow in the darkest night the sounds that may impel you
And the song that I am singing may disturb or serve to quell you
If all the sounds you hear ain't what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream

The rising smell of fresh-cut grass
Smothered cities choke and yell with fuming gas
I hold some grapes up to the sun
And their flavour breaks upon my tongue.
With eager tongues we taste our strife
And fill our lungs with seas of life.
Come taste and smell the waters of our time.

And close your lips, child, so softly I might kiss you,
Let your flower perfume out and let the winds caress you.
As I walk on through the garden, I am hoping I don't miss you
If all the things you taste ain't what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream .

The sun and moon both arise
And we'll see them soon through days and nights
But now silver leaves are mirrors, bring delights.
And the colours of your eyes are fiery bright,
While darkness blinds the skies with all its light.
Come see where your eyes cannot see.

And close your eyes, child, and look at what I'll show you;
Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes blow you,
And maybe when we meet then suddenly I will know you.
If all the things you see ain't
quite what they seem,
Then don't mind me 'cos I ain't nothin' but a dream .
And you can follow; And you can follow; follow...",421,52

The very best in life is free

Baby I'm telling you
This is what you should do

Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, just say the word, and they are yours

Just help yourself to the love
In my heart your smile has opened up the door.

Could never buy what I can give

Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, and then lets really start to live

My heart has love enough for two
More than enough for me and you
I'm rich with love, a millionaire
I've so much, it's unfair
Why don't you take a share

Just help yourself to the love,

When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end

Was a song outside my window, and the
traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells,
and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtain, and
a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome
you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay,
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a
portait of today
And the streets are paved with passerby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a
bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
and stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the
rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay

Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning",228,48

In the closed-down market
Kicking up the paper,
with his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
Hands held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking,
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags.

Chorus

In the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven,
Same old man is sitting there on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his tea-cup,
Each tea last an hour
Then he wanders home alone

Chorus

Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman's Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city,
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care

Spoken:
These are the times that try men's souls. In the course of our nation's history, the people of Boston have rallied
bravely whenever the rights of men have been threatened. Today, a new crisis has arisen. The Metropolitan
Transit Authority, better known as the M. T. A., is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population in the
form of a subway fare increase. Citizens, hear me out! This could happen to you!

(Eight bar guitar, banjo introduction)

Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charley on a tragic and fateful day.
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family, went to ride on the M. T. A.
Chorus:
Well, did he ever return? No, he never returned and his fate is still unknown. (What a pity! Poor ole Charlie. Shame and scandal. He may ride forever. Just like Paul Revere.)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston. He's the man who never returned.

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square Station and he changed for Jamaica Plain.
When he got there the conductor told him, &amp;quot;One more nickel.&amp;quot; Charlie couldn't get off of that train.

(Chorus)

Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station, crying, &amp;quot;What will become of me?!!
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea or my cousin in Rocksbury?&amp;quot;

(Chorus)

Charlie's wife goes down to the Sculley Square Station every day at quarter past two,
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin' through.

(Chorus)

Now, you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal how the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase! Vote for George O'Brien! Get poor Charlie off the M. T. A.

He's the man who never returned. He's the man who never returned. Ain't you Charlie?",319,37

Emmylou Harris,To Daddy - 2003 Remaster,Folk,"(Dolly Parton)

Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

The only thing that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

He often left her all alone but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she don't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it our ears could not believe it
The words she had written there to daddy.

She said the kids are older now they don't need me very much
And I've gone in search of love I need so badly
I have needed you so long without you things can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home.

But she did, she never did say so to daddy

As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power

Judy Collins,Someday Soon,Folk,"There's a young man that I know, his age is twenty-one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service
And he's lookin' for his fun
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

My parents can not stand him 'cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the toughest road I know
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

And when he comes to call, my pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's just as wild in the younger days

So blow, you old Blue Northern, blow my love to me
He's drivin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

When he comes to call, my pa ain't got a word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's just as wild in the younger days

Blow, you old blue northern, blow my love to me

Blind Willie Johnson,Trouble Will Soon Be Over,Folk,"When you're weary, and feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down

When you're down and out, and on the street
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you
I'll take your part, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will ease your mind

I will ease your mind",154,21
Burl Ives,Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,Folk,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

Woody Guthrie,John Henry,Folk,"John Henry when he was a baby
settin' on his mammy's knee
picked up an hammer in his little right hand
Said ""Hammer be the death of me me me,
hammer be the death of me!""

Some say he's born in Texas
Some say he's born up in Maine
I just say he was a Louisiana man
Leader of a steel-driving chain gang
leader on a steel-driving gang

""Well"", the captain said to John Henry
""I'm gonna bring my steam drill around
gonna whup that steel on down down down
whup that steel on down!""

John Henry said to the captain (what he say?)
""You can bring your steam drill around
gonna bring my steam drill out on the job
I'll beat your steam drill down down down
beat your steam drill down!""

John Henry said to his Shaker
""Shaker you had better pray
If you miss your six feet of steel
It'll be your buryin' day day day
It'll be your buryin' day!""

Now the Shaker said to John Henry
""Man ain't nothing but a man
but before I'd let that steam drill beat me down
I'd die with an hammer in my hand hand hand
I'd die with an hammer in my hand!""

John Henry had a little woman
Her name was Polly Anne
John Henry took sick and was laid up in bed
While Polly handled steel like a man man man
Polly handled steel like a man.

They took John Henry to the graveyard
laid him down in the sand
Every locomotive comin' a-rolling by by by
hollered ""there lies a steel-drivin' man man man
there lies a steel-drivin' man!""",274,46

Jonathan Richman,I Was Dancing In The Lesbian Bar,Folk,"A voice like honey, no one else could fill his shoes
The time and the weather, the headlines and the local news
He lays it down with perfection and grace
He’s done by noon, he goes home to his place
Where he sleeps and he waits for the night

Just before midnight he gets up, gets out of bed
A can of Red Bull, a tab of X to clear his head
He shoots his cuffs, now he’s headed downtown
Picks up one life, puts another one down
And his body hums and the music’s playing

Dance, Soterios Johnson, dance
It’s a cold world, nobody understands
The feeling you can’t keep inside
Go, Soterios Johnson, go
All the club kids are watching your glowstick glow
With the light of a truth you can’t hide
That the news is the news, but the dance goes on forever

He shimmies his shoulders, undulates his slender hips
Arms akimbo, Jaggeresque, he pouts his lips
A circle forms, everybody comes round
Just to hear the incredible sound
Of a genius smashing expectations

Dance, Soterios Johnson, dance
It’s a cold world, nobody understands
The feeling you can’t keep inside
Go, Soterios Johnson, go
All the club kids are watching your glowstick glow
With the light of a truth you can’t hide
That the news is the news, but the dance goes on forever

He’s dancing, he’s a machine
Like no one, that they’ve ever seen
He’s flying, he’s living a dream

The magic fades as the sun comes up, it’s time he goes
A hand on his shoulder, he turns around: it’s Teri Gross
He takes her hand, spins her body just so
He holds her close, they will never let go
As the room explodes, they dance like angels

Dance, Soterios Johnson, dance
It’s a cold world, nobody understands
The feeling you can’t keep inside
Go, Soterios Johnson, go
All the club kids are watching your glowstick glow
With the light of a truth you can’t hide
That the news is the news, but the dance goes on forever",345,51
Lead Belly,Poor Howard / Green Corn,Folk,"(Page/Plant)

Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, Always knew what's goin on
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's done, been lazin' out in the noonday sun

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dress down

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae (?)
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her runnin' around

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done

All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Joni Mitchell,"Intro To Night In The City - Live at The 2nd Fret, Philadelphia, PA, 11/1966",Folk,"It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mothers' home
She went to Florida and left you
With you father`s gun, alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see, who in the world I might be

I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
ON the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see, who in the world you might be

You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see, who in the world you might be",144,24

Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

`Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil,
and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge,
last night a half past two
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye
and so long as we went rolling through
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something
that I've never been shown

And I saw my devil,
and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from
Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remembered something you once told me

Townes Van Zandt,Our Mother the Mountain,Folk,"By townes van zandt

My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon's dancin' purple
All through her black hair
And a ladies-in-waiting she stands 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon
On the false and the fair

She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
Her skin fits her tightly
And her lips do not lie
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
Slowly she twirls it
In front of my eyes

I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her
The satin she's wearin'
Is shimmering blue
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping
My dogs have gone hunting
The howling is through



So I reach for her hand and her eyes turns to poison
And her hair turns to splinters,
And her flesh turns to brine
She leaps cross the room, she stands in the window
And screams that my first-born
Will surely be blind

She throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
She's parted her lips
But she makes not a sound
I fly down the stairway, and I run to the garden
No trace of my true love
Is there to be found

So walk these hills lightly, and watch who you're lovin'
By mother the mountain
I swear that it's true
Love not a woman with hair black as midnight
And her dress made of satin
All shimmering blue",239,45

Run–D.M.C.,Christmas In Hollis,Hip Hop,"[Run]
It was December 24th on Hollis Ave in the dark
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer
But then I was illin because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone
But he left and dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said &amp;quot;Santa Claus&amp;quot;
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me

[D.M.C.]
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistle toe as we drink egg nog
The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Chrsitmas carrols

Rhymes so loud and prod you hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit

And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

know I'm blissed

Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine

What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, no one could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow
I need blow
And I said woah little hottie
I'm not DeLorian, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

Were the two he left you with

And the price was far too long

You'll let the bad luck in

Broke his own heart
Poured it in the ground
Big red tree grew up and out
Throws up its leaves
And spins round and round

I know all this and more
So take your hat off
When you're talkin' to me
And be there when
I feed the tree

This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs
They put silver where her teeth had been
Baby silver tooth, she grins and wins

I know all this and more
So take your hat off
When you're talkin' to me
And be there when
I feed the tree

Spins around, around
Around the tree

Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done.

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done.

When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold.

When the bird has flown
Got no-one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown.

When the game's been fought
You speed the ball across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought.

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through.

Kicked my ass out of school...
Rolled me out into the streets...
Hitched a ride on a monkey's back...
Headed west into the black...

The kind of girl you want to know
From her head down to her toenails
Down to her feet, yeah

And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
Going back in Chinatown
Three's not a crowd to her, she says
""Room 714, I'll be waiting""
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

Temptations sing!

Chicago - Beginnings Lyrics
Robert Lamm: Keyboard, Vocals

When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are,
Or what we're doing. I'm with you, that's all that matters.
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing.
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no,
I wish I could sing it to you.
Mostly I'm silent.
Never think about words to say.
When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings.
The color of chills all over my body.
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no,
Try to put into words.
Mostly I'm silent.
Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever.
Only the beginning. Only just the start.
I've got to get you into my life.
Got to get you next to me.
Only the beginning. Only just the start.",154,23

Gang Starr,Mass Appeal,Hip Hop,"Verse One: Guru

No way you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I break kids
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills nag you can't compare me
And no we don't make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin real facts
I represent set up shit like a tent boy
You're paranoid cause you're my son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Verse Two:

Oh yes I'm greater than all MC's when I breeeze give me room please
I be like fascinatin when I be updatin
Cuttin off wack kids, pullin their trump cards
I thump hard, and mak eem say that I'm God
Niggaz be pretendin they hardcore
Never know the meaning of [real hardcore]
But I get props like a slogan and no man
Could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
No double checking vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to I go all out with no mic
Yeah that's right cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
Cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

Verse Three:

I know I'm dope but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks but now I'm makin greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop
of pure bomb, just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond I go on and on
For you it's tragic I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I betcha
Those who kick dirt and do time I'm gonna get cha
Cause I be kickin the real
While they be losin the race tryin to chase mass appeal",400,54

Bad Meets Evil,Fast Lane,Hip Hop,"The silent stray inertia
No burden on my back
No determinance, no ballast
No chance of looking back
It doesn't matter what's ahead
It's time I'll hit it hard
No fixing my position
No sign of retard
It's the fast life
There's nothing I can do
The fast life
Suck it in and follow through
The fast life
Just learning as I go
You might call it careless
but this fast life
is all I've ever known
Like a wispy feather
Defying gravity
Or a rolling cobble
in the middle of the stream
Propelled by a ghost force
that never shows his face
Increase the ante
of this perpetual pace

There's nothing I can do
The fast life
Suck it in and follow through
The fast life
Just learning as I go
You might call it careless
but this fast life
is all I've ever known

I came out of the womb
my head was always bouncing
off the walls in the room
Always scratching gravel
Covering new ground
No matter how hard they tried
they couldn't pin me down

There's nothing I can do

The Pharcyde,Drop,Hip Hop,"Bootie Brown:

Let me freak the funk,
obsolete is the punk that talk more junk than Sanford sells
I jet propel at a rate that complice their mental state
as I invade their masquerade
they couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted
for an easy out, I leave mc's with doubt
of exceeding, my name is Bottie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading,
they try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle, of O.E.
they have no key, or no clue
to the game at all, now they washed up
hung out to dry
standing looking stpud, wondering why
(why man?)
it was the fame, that they tried to get
now they walking around talkin about represent
and keep it real, but I got to appeal
cause they exisitng in a fantasy when holding the steel

Slim Kid 3:

rock a bye baby,
listen to my heart pumping to a fine ravine
of all things it's a vain of a shrine
all missions impossible are possible, cause I'm
heading for a new sector 365 days fron now, I'll
wipe the sweat from my brow
and each and every true will stick, or fall from the sky of my cloud nine
from homies all the way to chics, no matter how fine
cotrolling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
you hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
and the worlds at a stand-still
deep in broken mansville, trapped in the moat with an avil, still
killing yourself, and dogging ya health
you ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

Knumbskull #1:

shit is-shit is ill, my flow still will spill
toxic slick to shock you sick like electrocute
when I execute, acutely over the rythym
on those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give em
got em mad and tremblin
cause I been up in my lab assemblin
misslies, to bomb the enemy
because they envy me, and the making of my mad currency
currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
and I think they can't follow
they can't swollow, the truth because it hurts
this is how I put it down, this is my earth, my turf
the worth of my birth is a billion, and you know what time it is
I'm going to make a million",453,59

Give a little light
give a little love

Maybe there's enough for everyone.
Give a little hope and a little trust

Maybe there's enough for everyone

Why should we live with this hatred?
We are all dancing on a thin line

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface

I can't seem
To find myself again

So insecure

Distracting
Reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection

Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning I walk towards the edge...
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around.

It's become a habit
A way
To start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid

Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chop these drums off
Truly yours, G Rap

In this land of lyrical loss, black
I'm not the cool sleet stack
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poison to few, niggas who be bitin styles I'm like pork to
Oooh...what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the style's from the cess
Shit be fuckin with my eye as I pull it to the chest

Throwin emcees to the fire from out da fryin' pan
It ain't no use in tryin, man
Son, stop cryin
Frontin' like you death-defyin'
You need to stop lyin'
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now lemme hear your verse while I'm chokin' you
With bubbly fine rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?)
Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown

And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up

I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know, it's not alright

I wonder how clear it must look from there to here
No obstruction, this selfish corruption all in this atmosphere
No fear, less tears, only time to catch my breath
I fail to inhale, your love constricts my chest
Confusion blinded me - mental and physically
And its because of you that now I can see

So now I can run
I follow the Son and ride on to Zion
And dance this last song of freedom
But only time will tell, if its truly for real
Cant change your mind, all I know this is what I feel
Whether I'm wrong or right please keep my life in sight
And never take your eyes off me

As I look up to the sky today
Well I can see you looking down on me
It brings a smile to my face again

Satellite....Satellite

Its truly one of a kind, like star shine, beyond night time
Are you there?
My eyes stare to find just what's behind this blind notion of mine
Is it genuine?
'Cause sometimes, it plays tricks with my mind
Some call it asinine
But its like love or hate, now is that real or fake?
'Cause its a real thin line, but that's your choice to make
The question at hand, help me understand
Is this your plan?
I think I can, can I think, then I think I can
Because I wont break (nah) and I wont shake (nah)
With lifted hands to this Man (Jah) I'll stand in faith
I'll make it through - my trust in you
Close my eyes, make a wish, kiss the sky, hey there - I see you

When I look up to the sky today
I can feel you looking down on me
It brings a smile to my face again

Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?",326,45
Daughter,Medicine,Hip Hop,"Hit me hit me hit me I'm already on the ground
You're asleep in the next room and I'm banging to be found
I cannot feel my body and I'm floating then I'm drowned
And nothing I have taken keeps it down

It's a ride

Help me help me help me it's a bitter hit to take
When I'm shaking once again this is too long to be awake
With the ignorance of new year
You could save me for your sake
Because I'm falling through the plans that we made

It's a ride

My medicine

Happy happy happy you can lie behind the eyes
Without telling those around you that you've built your own disguise
Now time can only end it when the remedy's not found
Just wrap it up and never take it out

It's alright",138,23
Crossfade,Cold,Hip Hop,"Looking back at me, I see
That I never really got it right

Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold, never meant to be so cold

Is I'm sorry for the way I am

Cold to you, I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You can see me stand on my own again
'Cause now I can see
You are the antidote that got me by

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed-up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things should of known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say

To be specific more times than dimes in a briz-nick
When you broke North, I crashed the barbecue like Riddick
At the Garden, true, that's the god in me, pardon you

Call back my secretary gatekeeper
Like I ain't peep her, I said, &quot;Darling you was stupid though
You know the Super Villain ... hoe!&quot;

I had this style ever since I was a child
I got this other style I ain't flip in a while, it goes:
Pure scientific intelligence, with one point of relevance
MC's whose styles need Vellamints
And once the smoke clears, tell 'em it's

On 99 plus one of them
And with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him

Me and my duns and them
Actual true and living sons of them
Dead planets and God-U's
Throwing divine rules to come through, we will over charge you's
Fool, and won't feel remorse for shit
Except for one time, once I had took my fronts out and lost them shits
Scientific gone bezerk like Red Alert
I really wanted to pick up was [?] for cheddar dirt
The funniest experiments is where I went
Obviously dead bent, and spent every red cent
To rule you, and still drop more jewels than schools do
Or even TV news that's designed to fool you (who?)
Yeah you, who hear the most grimy suggestions
From brothers with fly names and I.D. questions
That's a Secret like Victoria teddy sets that's edible
Them's not ready yet for the incredible
Team of MC's who broke off fakes
Who thought they were slaughta proof

Stomping through like North Face waterproof

But that's the nature of the game
And you have to play

Bring back the pain of a god that's never blue
You're in control of the whole damned universe
Bring back the shame and the bright lights on a few
It keeps me coming back to you

The deaths were faked, the laughs were cries
But ressurrections are doing fine
You got me walking into suicide
And I'll be there right by your side
In reproduction at your merry go bye bye

Here to paradise they go
Brighter made is their woe
As above, so below

We reached for an outside point of view
But its out of touch with me and you
I feel I'm walking into suicide
But you'll be right there by my side
To beam my message into space as I die

Bring back the shame of the many for the few
Get on your knees and I'll be coming back to you
Bring back the pain of an inverse world for two
It keeps me coming back to you",204,32

So I can rip through the ligaments

Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I had you with you motherfuckers betta duck
I bring pain, blood stains on blood of what remains
of his jacket, he had a gun he should'eve packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode down ya asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore, C-4 to ya door no beef no more
Nigga, feel the rush, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous

You wouldn't do nothing for me baby, oh you wouldn't do anything I asked you to

Rod Wave,Heart On Ice,Hip Hop,"I didn't know what day it was
when you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
the attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
that in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsly prints
I put down to experience

The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
but my heart cried out for you

Chorus:

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance

You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey what do you see in me

(Chorus)

You're an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
but you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
'cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found

Its heavy on the roof,
On the roof above your head.
Tomorrow is a lovers town,
Thats been beaten down.
Hand of winter holds,
life we've lived.
Instead of drowning in dispair,
For I find small comfort in a bottle
When we're apart.
They say don't let the teardrops rust you shining heart.

I used to drive all night for you,
While the children were asleep.
As the dawn broke on your roof,
Back into the house I'd creep.
Where my husband slept alone,
Of course he must have known.
For we always hide the truth
for fear of losing what we own.
So don't forget the words that we choose,
And constantly misuse.
For they were written down
Everytime we were apart.
They say don't let the teardrops rust your shining heart.

Ministry,Just One Fix,Hip Hop,"blood keeps drinking away
certain of its destination
driving through new orleans at night
gotta find a destination

just one fix

life keeps slipping away
fighting in a war with damnation
poised, keep cutting away

just one fix

like if i boarded a train
trying to take in another station
join us and the choice will be made
unless we kill the lie as a nation

System Of A Down,I-E-A-I-A-I-O,Hip Hop,"There’s another world inside of me that you may never see,
There’s secrets in this life that I can’t hide.
Well, somewhere in this darkness, there’s a light that I can’t find
Well, maybe it's too far away, or maybe I’m just blind
Maybe I’m just blind

Chorus

So hold me when I’m here,
Right me when I’m wrong,
Hold me when I’m scared,
And love me when I’m gone.

Everything I am,
And everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I’ll never let you down,
Even if I could,
Give up everything,
If only for your good,

So hold me when I’m here,
Right me when I’m wrong,
Hold me when I’m scared,
You won’t always be there,
So love me when I’m gone.
So love me when I’m gone

Refrain

When your execution x-ray cannot see under my skin,
I won’t tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends.
Now roaming through this darkness, I’m alive but I’m alone,
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone.

Chorus

So hold me when I’m here,
Right me when I’m wrong,
Hold me when I’m scared,
And love me when I’m gone.

Everything I am,
And everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I’ll never let you down,
Even if I could,
Give up everything,
If only for your good,

So hold me when I’m here,
Right me when I’m wrong,
Hold me when I’m scared,
You won’t always be there,
So love me when I’m gone.

Maybe I’m just blind.

Tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself
I need to rewind myself
Lookin for the payback
Listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one
Yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son
And it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills it helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name
They say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me
It's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay
To be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands
Still I can't find love
And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around

And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around

People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand 'bout the shit that I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone....I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I forgot all things I miss
Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times
And I still stand firm
You get what you put in
And people get what they deserve
Still I ain't seen mine
No I ain't seen mine
I've been giving just ain't been gettin'
I've been walking that there line
So I think i'll keep on walking

I'll keep moving on and only God knows why

Were the two he left you with

That you never knew you were young

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

No one knew me, no one knew me

Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You alright?

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of them (naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand (nigga, talk to me please)
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sista had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak.
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin',

This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock (a rhyme), that's right (on time)

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...it's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tricky) Trrrrrrrrrrricky

Verse 1

I met this little girly, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said &amp;quot;It's not that easy&amp;quot;

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...(How is it D?) It's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Trrrrrricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...Tricky (Tricky) Tricky

Verse 2

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really (hope) but we just (walk) because we have no time
And in the city it's a pity cos we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...(How is it D?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) huh!

Verse 3

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cos I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' cos they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cos I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father cos he's down with me

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...(How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr...

Verse 4

We are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)
They offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone
It's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit
You keep on (rock!) shock! Cos this is it......",426,57

Kid Cudi,Up Up & Away,Hip Hop,"Girl, I just can't live without you
I know I hurt you
That's the last thing I meant to do
Sometimes I can be careless and blind
Can you forgive the fool that I've been?

You know I love you
You're the one thing I have that's true
My life used to be nothing to me
I never want to feel that again

[Chorus: ]
If you go away girl
You're taking my heart with you
If you go away girl
You'll be breaking my heart in two
If you only stay girl
I promise you the world
So please don't ever go away

You know I need you
I'm so sorry that I made you cry
You are everything good in my life
Your tears have finally opened my eyes

[Chorus ]
I was so wrong to ever look at another baby
Even the strongest man can stumble and fall
And I'll do anything for you
Anything to be in your arms again
Baby don't let this be the end

[Chorus ]
Girl, I just can't live without you

Never, ever leave me girl
You promised your love to me forever
Say you'll never leave me girl [repeat and fade]",201,38

We said our goodbyes.
But I can't go a day without your face going through my mind.
In fact, not a single minute
passes without you in it.
Your voice, your touch.
Memories of your love are with me all of the time.

Let me let go, baby.
Let me let go.
If this is for the best why are you still in my heart,
are you still in my soul?
Let me let go.

I talked to you the other day,
oh looks like you made your escape.
You put us behind;
no matter how I try, I can't do the same.

Let me let go, baby won't you
Let me let go.
It just isn't right, I've been two thousand miles
down a dead-end road.

Let me let go

The lights of this strange city are shining,
but they don't hold no fascination for me.
I try to find the bright side baby,
but everywhere I look,
everywhere I turn,
you're all I see.

Let me...
Let me let go, baby won't you
Let me let go.
It just isn't right, I've been two thousand miles
down a dead-end road.

Oh let me let go, darlin', won't you?
I just gotta know
if this is for the best why are you still in my heart,
you're still in my soul
Let me let go, why don't you

With romantic music and the lights down low
And as you stand there amazed at the door
And you're wondering what all this is for
It's just a simple thing from me to you
The lady that I adore
Cause there's something that you should know

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow
And I said ""Now that I've found you
I'm never letting go""

There is no reason to the things that we do
You can break a heart with just a word or two
And take a lifetime to apologise
When the one you love's in front of your eyes
And I will fall to my knees like a fool
If it's the only way of getting through
You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is gonna feel it too
So there's only on thing to do

It's that I've been missing you

And that I've been thinking about it everyday
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow
Because now I've found you
I'm never letting... go.",233,35

I seem like someone else.

I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man, he's just a man.
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways:
He's just one more

Should I bring him down? Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love - let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this - what's it all about?

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position?
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so.

I never thought I'd come to this - what's it all about

Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost, I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.
I'd turn my head, I'd back away,
I wouldn't want to know -

So when you put this muthafucka to the test
You gotta realize somethin, nigga: (you fuckin with the very best)

I can't talk to my mother, so I talk to my diary
I'm goin off on the deep end
I find myself face to face with myself while I'm sleepin

You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this muthafucka before he gets to me

Tony Bennett,Once Upon a Time,Jazz,"Hey girl what ya doin' down there
Dancin' alone every night while I live right above you
I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me you don't even know me
I love you

Oh, my darling, knock three times on the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe if the answer is no, oh, my sweetness
(Knock, knock, knock!) Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mmm, twice on the pipe (clink, clink) means you ain't gonna show

If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note that's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart

I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me you don't even know me

Billie Holiday,Stars Fell On Alabama,Jazz,"We lived our little drama.
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

I can't forget the glamour.
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly.
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center, just you and me, dear.

My heart beat like a hammer.
My arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

We lived our little drama.

George Olsen,The Slave of Love,Jazz,"He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.

I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.

(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.

(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...

(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd verse, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th verse ''I went to see my
friend today may be found saying ''I went to see him just today'')",238,42
Julie London,Misty,Jazz,"Artist(Band):Ella Fitzgerald

Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.
Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.
On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
Too misty,
And too much
In love.....",131,23

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos


Everybody knows some tofu and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight


They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly


And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas to.. You!",114,24

And the first time, ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command
My Love.

And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last, til the end of time

There we are, darling, only you and I
What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful

And we'll do some carolling

Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

I'm talkin to the shadow one o'clock till four,
And Lord, how slow the moments go and all I do is pour
Black coffee since the blues caught my eye;
I'm hangin' out on Monday my Sunday dreams to dry.

(Bridge)
Now man is born to come a-lovin',
And a woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And down her past regrets in coffee and cigarettes.

I'm moonin' all the mornin', moanin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine and not much heart to fight.
Black coffee - feelin' low as the ground.

When I first started walking on wing
But how long can a man or woman ever hope to hide
Love that's locked up inside
Every story worth the spinning
Must have a beginning.

Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
the way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore.

We'll say ""no man!
But you can do the job when you're in town""
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin'
In spite of the chill in the weather
Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walkin' and hopin' together
Together, together, together

Sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin?
In the lane, snow is glist'nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows ain't it thrillin'
Tho' your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play, the eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Winter wonder, winter wonderland
Winter winter, wonder wonderland",279,50
Carmen McRae,You Took Advantage Of Me,Jazz,"I'm a sentimental sap that's all,
What's the use of trying not to fall.
I have no will, you've made your kill,
Cause you took advantage of me.

I'm just like an apple on a bough,
And you're going shake me down somehow.
But what's the use, you've cooked my goose,
Cause you took advantage of me.

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know my elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go, it's much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned.
So lock the doors and call me yours,
Cause you took advantage of me.

I have no will, you've made your kill,
Cause you took advantage of me.

Tell me, what's the use, you've cooked my goose,
Cause you took advantage of me.

Say, I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know my elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go, it's much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned.
So lock the doors and call me yours,
You took advantage of poor, little me.",204,31
Nina Simone,Lilac Wine,Jazz,"James Shelton

I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because I brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love...",160,27

And I'm starting to sink
So tired of struggling
That my mind can barely think
I don't know where I'm going
Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do

My Fuel supply is finished
There ain't nothing left to burn
I need someone to help me
But I don't know which way to turn
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night

I'm rolling and tumbling
Spinning end over end
Got to have some peace and quiet
So I can find myself again
Still if you ask me what's the matter
I just don't know what to say

There's people all around me
But I feel so alone
I guess they'd like to help me
But I have to do it on my own

They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
so I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere inside these walls

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
man who swears he's not to blame
ALl day long I hear him hollering so loud
just crying out that he's not to blame

Waiting for the plane to leave,
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay,
Bear with me please,""

They gave us the usual hassle,
""You can't take those guitars on board,""
But the boys in the band just smiled,
Heard it all before,

And as they're starting to serve champagne,
To the folks at the front of the plane,
I can hear the engines roaring, we're on our way, And we are flying home,
I feel the freedom in my soul,
Flying home at last;
Flying home,
I've got the freedom in my soul,
And it's four in the morning,
My world is calling,
Speeding through the universe tonight... The movie reminds of my lady,
As she waits, ""where are those guys?""
Yes it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky,

And now the sun is beginning to rise,
It's like looking down on Paradise,
There's a ball of fire that's burning, giving life, And we are flying home,
I feel the freedom in my soul,
Flying home at last;
Flying home,
I've got the freedom in my soul,
And it's four in the morning,
My world is calling,
Speeding through the universe tonight...",205,33

Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside, where I hide with my loneliness

In a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon

Every town was Paris
Every day was Sunday
Every month was May

When Joanna loved me
Every sound was music
Music made of laughter
Laughter that was bright and gay

Her touch, her smile, and for a little while

She loves me

Judy Garland,The Man That Got Away - Live At Carnegie Hall/1961,Jazz,"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
And suddenly you're older
And all because
Of the man
That got away

No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen its final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Good riddance, good-bye
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he will turn up
There's just no let up
The live long night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man
That got away

The man that got away",168,44

And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two

Many times, many ways

White bird,
in a golden cage,
alone.

The leaves blow,
Across the long black road.
To the darkened skies,
in its rage

But the white bird just sits in her cage,
unknown.

White bird must fly
Or she will die

White bird,
dreams of the aspen trees,
with their dying leaves,
turning gold.

But the white bird just sits in her cage,
growing old.

White bird must fly or she will die.
White bird must fly or she will die.

The sunsets come, the sunsets go.
The clouds roll by,and the earth turns old.
And the young bird's eyes do always glow.

She must fly,
She must fly,
She must fly.

In a golden cage,
On a winter's day, in the rain.

In a golden cage alone.

No communication will kill it every time

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near

Why not use your mentality - step up, wake up to reality?

Charles Mingus,Jelly Roll,Jazz,"Hey everybody,
Let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done

So let the good times roll,
I said let the good times roll,
I don't care if you're young or old,
You oughtta get together and let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumbling
Talkin' trash
If you want to have a ball,
You got to go out and spend some cash

And let the good times roll now,
I'm talkin' `bout the good times,
Well it makes no difference whether you're young or old,
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

Hey y'all tell everybody, Ray Charles in town,
I got a dollar and a quarter and I'm just ringing the clock,
But don't let no female, play me cheap,
I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep.

So let the good times roll now,
I tell y'all I'm gonna let the good times roll now,
Well it don't make no difference if you're young or old,
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

Hey no matter whether, rainy weather,
If you want to have a ball, you got to get yourself together,
Oh, get yourself under control, woah, and let the good times roll.",219,33
Fats Waller,Honeysuckle Rose,Jazz,"Every honey bee fills with jealousy,
when they see you out with me.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
and I know the reason why.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
seems the honey fairly drips.

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

It's not for me to say you'll always care.
Oh, but here for the moment, I can hold you fast
And press you lips to mine
And dream that love will last.

*As far as I can see, this is heaven;
And speaking just for me, it's ours to share.
Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With ev'ry passing day,
Or we may never meet again.
But then, it's not for me to say.

they say there's moonbeams i shoul view
but moonbeams being gold
are something i can't behold
'cause i was born to be blue

When i met you
the world was bright and sunny
when you left the courtain fell
i'd like to laugh
but nothing strikes me funny
now my world's a faded pastel

I guess i'm luckier than some folks
i've known the thrill of loving you

Bay Parkway wonder
You're such a success
Your pretty secretary, ha
She say you are the best

Your face always smiling
say you sure paid your dues
But I know inside
You've got the Bensonhurst blues

Those custom-made ciggies
that you offer to me pretend
and pretend to care about my family

And those pictures on your desk
All them lies that you abuse
Do they know you suffer
from the Bensonhurst blues

Your grandmother's accent
still embarrasses you
You're even ashamed
of the French you once knew

You're part of the chance now
They break you making the news
But I know inside
you've got the Bensonhurst blues

But thanks for the lesson
Cause the life that I choose
won't make me feel like living
with the Bensonhurst blues

And don't, don't try to write me
And don't bother to call
Cause I'll be in conference

You start restin' Sunday and rest so hard
You're tired the whole week long

Stan Getz,Over The Rainbow,Jazz,"Listen!

The rain is falling on the roses
The fragrance drifts across the garden
Like the scent of some forgotten melody
This melody, belongs to you, belongs to me, belongs to no one

See the way the crimson petals scatter when the wind blows

Ah! The secret sigh of love that suddenly the heart knows

See now a robin's there among the puddless
And, hopping through the misty rain drops
He's come to tell us it is spring

Look at the double rainbow
The rain is silver in the sun light
A fleeting fox is in the garden
Rain sweet lovin'mother rain

That soaks the earth
That swells the streams
That cleans the sky
And brings the blue

See how the jasmin tree is all in flower!

The little brook of clever waters flows into a vast
river

Ah! you belong to no one...",144,31
Ella Fitzgerald,You're The Top,Jazz,"At words poetic I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest - unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading,
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! you're the Collosseum,
You're the top! you're the Louvre Museum,
You're the melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet,
A Shakespeare Sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse!

You're the Nile! You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile, on the Mona Lisa!
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop!
But if baby I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top, you're Mahatma Gandhi,
You're the top! you're Napoleon brandy,
You're the purple light, of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gallery, you're Garbo's salary,
You're cellophane!

You're sublime, you're a turkey dinner,
You're the time, of the Derby Winner,
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop;
But if baby I'm by the bottom you're the top!

You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad
You're the top, you're a Berlin ballad
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire
You're an O'Neal drama, you're Whistler's mama, you're camembert

You're a rose, you're inferno's Dante
You're the nose, on the great Durante
I'm a lazy lout who's just about to stop
But if baby I'm the bottom,
You're the top!",245,43

Billie Holiday,I'm In a Low Down Groove,Jazz,"Al Dubin / Harry Warren

You told me that I was like an angel
Told me I was fit to wear a crown
So that you could get a thrill
You put me on a pedestal
And then you let me down, let me down.

You told me that I'd be wearing diamonds
I would have the smartest car in town
Made me think that I'm the top
And then you let the ladder drop
You know you let me down, let me down

I walked upon a rainbow
I clung onto a star
You had me up in heaven
That's why I had to tall so far

I was even looking for a cottage
I was measured for a wedding gown
That how I got cynical
You put me on a pinnacle
And then you let me down, let me down
How you let me down",147,25

Johnny Mathis,What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?,Jazz,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",305,53

I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some mad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages
With 10,000 people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

Verse 2:
I know your image of me is what I hoped to be
I treated you unkindly
And darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby can't you see through me
Cause we we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

Verse 3:
You taught me precious secrets
Of a true love, you wanted nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
Now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
Cuz my love is in there hiding

(Piano Break)
Verse 4: (2x)
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Your a friend of mine
And when my life is over

We we're alone and I was singing this song to you (repeat last line 2x)",193,33

far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops

Ella Fitzgerald,The Lady Is A Tramp,Jazz,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan stew and never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I love the rowing on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",248,37

With my man

He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms

Blue eyes holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me
Blue eyes ooh I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home
And I am home again

How high the moon
There is no moon above

Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

It's where you are
Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?
Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance?
Isn't it romance?

When we wanna play, we play
In a happy setting, we're getting
Some fun out of life

Maybe we do the right things
Maybe we do the wrong

Wending our way along



But when we want to sing, we sing
When we want to dance, we dance
You can do your betting, we're getting

You gotta work late""
Sometimes I wonder
What I'm-a gonna do

""Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car
To go ridin' next Sunday""

Told the boss I was sick
""You can't use the car
'Cuz you didn't work a lick""

why, I spend Such lonely nights
dreaming of a song
That melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new,
And each kiss . an inspiration
Oooh but that was long ago
Now my consolation, is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale hums his fairy tale
of paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
Always In my heart it will remain baby
My stardust melody,
the memory of love's refrain,
and now the urle dusk of twilight time
steals acorss the dust of my heart- my heart!",114,21

Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time he will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls",163,25

You praise the Lord, It's all you say

Jesus saves, Listen to you pray
You think you'll see the pearly gates
When death takes you away

For all respect you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate Satanas rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy

Jesus saves, No need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems you've lost your way

Jesus saves, No words of praise
No promised land to take you to
There is no other way",146,29

And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

Here I am - on the road again
There I am - up on the stage
Here I go - playing star again

And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches, ""is it woman? is it man?""
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

There I am - up on the stage
Here I go - playing star again
There I go - turn the page

Oo-ooh, out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play, yeah

Later in the evening,as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

He-ey

Yeah

And what you have put others through

Or perhaps you think that when you're dead
you just stay in your grave

or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book
when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath
or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope
do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light
and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared
at the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
that God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes,
just realize that he's the one
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes!

the heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights.

My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone).

Victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire

Casting his shadow, weaving his spell

Left all the people feeling so fine

Hanging up, I wanted to cry

Not for the power, just no more games

No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll hate me just the same

And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self abuse

Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true to late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death",243,42

I know it sounds a foolish thing to say,
But it don't matter baby, 'cos today's another day

CHORUS
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life.
You shine a little love on my life and let me see...

Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say it.
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on.
I know you've heard it all before,
But I realy need you, darlin', every day I need you more...

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better,
You came home without a word.
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her,
They couldn't see it and they just didn't understand,
And lookin' in the mirror, there were fools at either hand,

CHORUS

Can you understand (Yes I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you,
I really can't believe,
We're walkin' out into the world tonight,
We'll do it all again until the break of night,
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes.

And the sun was beating
On the soldiers by the side of the road
There was a bright light
A shattering of shop windows
The bomb in the baby carriage
Was wired to the radio

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

It was a dry wind
And it swept across the desert
And it curled into the circle of birth
And the dead sand
Falling on the children
And the mothers and the fathers
And the automatic earth

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all, oh yeah
The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

It's a turn around jump shot
It's everybody jump start
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Medicine is magical and magical is art, think of
The boy in the bubble
And the baby with the baboon heart

And I believe
These are days of lasers in the jungle
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
Staccato signals of constant information
A loose affiliation of millionaires
And billionaires, and baby

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all, oh yeah
The way we look to a distant constellation

While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping

What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and your ok

But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding

What am I suppose to say when I'm all choked up and your ok

just the right sound

That you are driving me out of my mind

That I want you just like a thousand other guys

your hands and gaze into your eyes

From the city that dreams,
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
Cross the valleys and streams,
For they're deep and they're wide
And the world's on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride.

Ring them bells St. Peter
Where the four winds blow,
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know.
Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells Sweet Martha,
For the poor man's son,
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one.
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep.

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through.
Ring them bells, for the time that flies,
For the child that cries
When innocence dies.

Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room,
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom.
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong.",218,43

Love don't come easy
This you know I understand

Show you things that you've dreamed of
Don't think that your dreaming
We've found the perfect love
And I'm like a cup come fill me up

Do what you want
You can use me all up
Take me bottom to top
Don't leave me with one drop

No,no,no do it tonight
You know the moment is right
Turn my brown body wild
Come let's dim all the lights

I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The Midwest farmers' daughters really make you feel all right
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

The West Coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian island dolls
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world

The Plimsouls,A Million Miles Away,Pop,"Friday night I'd just got back
I had my eyes shut
Was dreaming about the past
I thought about you while the radio played
Should've got moving
For some reason I stayed
I started drifing to a different place
I realized I was falling off the face of the world
And there was nothing left to bring me back...

I'm a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today

I took a ride and went downtown
The streets were empty
There was no one around
All the faces that we used to know
Gone from the places
That we used to go
I'm at the wrong end of the looking glass
Trying to hold on to the hands of the past and you
And there's nothing left to bring me back...

I'm a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today",149,25

The Association,Along Comes Mary,Pop,"Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to give me kicks , and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks
Whose sickness is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes
As who is most to blame today

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers
Will make them not the same

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

And when the morning of the warning's passed, the gassed
And flaccid kids are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone
The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies, and make them
Realize their urgent cry for sight no more

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch",289,41

Rush,The Big Money,Pop,"Well, I was only a kid, didn't know enough to be afraid
Playing the game, but not the way the big boys played
Nothing to lose, maybe I had something to trade
The way the big wheel spins

Well, I was only a kid, on a holy crusade
I placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made
Take no chances on paradise delayed
So I do a slow fade

Playing for time
Don't want to wait for heaven
Looking for love
For an angel to forgive my sins
Playing with fire
Chasing something new to believe in
Looking for love
The way the big wheel spins

Well, I was only a kid, cruising around in a trance
Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance
I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance
The way the big wheel spins

Well, I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance
Going for broke, going for another chance
Hoping for heaven, hoping for a fine romance
If I do the right dance

Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith
Taking your chances you'll have the right answers
When the final judgment begins

Wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate
Life redirected in ways unexpected
Sometimes the odd number wins
The way the big wheel spins",222,37

Hey hey hey

Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about when you got to choose

What's that you say Mrs. Robinson?
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away

Rush,A Farewell To Kings,Pop,"When they turn the pages of history
When these days have passed long ago
Will they read of us with sadness
For the seeds that we let grow?
We turned our gaze
From the castles in the distance
Eyes cast down
On the path of least resistance

Cities full of hatred, fear and lies
Withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes
Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise
Beating down the multitude and
Scoffing at the wise

The hypocrites are slandering
The sacred halls of Truth
Ancient nobles showering
Their bitterness on youth
Can't we find the minds that made us strong?
Can't we learn to feel what's right
And what's wrong?
What's wrong?

Cities full of hatred, fear and lies
Withered hearts and cruel, tormented eyes
Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise
Beating down the multitude and
Scoffing at the wise
Can't we raise our eyes and make a start?
Can't we find the minds to lead us
Closer to the Heart?",161,32
Rush,Red Barchetta,Pop,"My uncle has a country place, that no one knows about
He says it used to be a farm, before the Motor Law
And on Sundays I elude the 'Eyes', and hop the Turbine freight
To far outside the Wire, where my white-haired uncle waits

Jump to the ground
As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline
Run like the wind
As excitement shivers up and down my spine
Down in his barn
My uncle preserved for me an old machine -
For fifty-odd years
To keep it as new has been his dearest dream

I strip away the old debris, that hides a shining car
A brilliant red Barchetta, from a better, vanished time
Fire up the willing engine, responding with a roar!
Tires spitting gravel, I commit my weekly crime...

Wind in my hair -
Shifting and drifting -
Mechanical music -
Adrenalin surge -

Well-weathered leather
Hot metal and oil
The scented country air
Sunlight on chrome
The blur of the landscape
Every nerve aware

Suddenly, ahead of me, across the mountainside
A gleaming alloy air-car, shoots towards me, two lanes wide
I spin around with shrieking tires, to run the deadly race
Go screaming through the valley as another joins the chase

Run like the wind
Straining the limits of machine and man
Laughing out loud
With fear and hope, I've got a desperate plan

At the one-lane bridge
I leave the giants stranded
At the riverside
Race back to the farm
To dream with my uncle
At the fireside...",254,47

She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored

And she purrs like a kitten 'till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't nough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing I got the pink slip daddy

And coming off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen

I guess I'll go thru life kust catchin colds and missin' trains

I never miss a thing
I've had the measels and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart tho't you could break this jinx for me
that love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castlesin the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too
Your answer was 'Goodbye'
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

And lookin' in the mirror, there were fools at either hand,

Midway lights
Shining stars on summer nights

Days of barefoot freedom
Racing with the waves
Nights of starlit secrets
Crackling driftwood flames
Drinking by the lighthouse
Smoking on the pier
Still we saw the magic
Was fading every year

To watch the fireworks display
Dancing fires on the beach
Singing songs together

Go seek the lady
Who will give, not take away
Naked with stillness
On the edge of dawn she stays
Night starts to empty
That's when her song begins
She'll make you happy
She'll take you deep within her
Window lights for wanderers
Hide hard in your swollen eyes
Echoes of laughter
Hide in the cities thighs
Love catch these fragments
Swirling through the winds of night

To give a boy child back his sight
Extensions through dimensions
Leave you feeling cold and lame

Lana Del Rey,Brooklyn Baby,Pop,"I see your laughing and ah
Telling everyone in town
That you've made a fool of me
Well go ahead and talk some more 'cause
Baby I don't care no more
You don't bother me at all

'Cause I got news for you
I was untrue too
And I don't care what you say
So go and laugh some more 'cause
Baby I don't care no more
I've got another lover of my own

Step by step you put me down, always calling me a clown
If you ever go away, promise me that you'll stay
Far, far, far, far, far from me

Now that we've played our game
I guess we're both to blame
We tried to break each other's hearts
You had one jump on me but
I jumped twice you see
It's all over now be on your way

Lead solo

So long baby, be on your way
I had a ball, you thought I'd...fall
You had one jump on me but
I jumped twice you see
It's all over now be on your way

So long baby....be on your way
So long baby....be on your way
So long baby....be on your way",196,36

And why should I call your name,

I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The Midwest farmers' daughters really make you feel all right
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

The West Coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian island dolls
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world

Taylor Swift,Fifteen,Pop,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of nobody's way
It's your freshman new year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through those doors",383,55
ABBA,Why Did It Have To Be Me?,Pop,"When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw them away
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why

it's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
but in the end it's always me alone

And I'm losing my favourite game
you're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby
losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
but my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
a stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should have seen it when my hope was new
my heart is black and my body is blue

Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I’m lost and alone, chilled to the bone

Double talkers, backstreet walkers at every turn
Seedy motels and no star hotels still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my mind
Was the sweet love I had with you

So who is rich and who is poor

You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen
In the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost
Well, this is true and yet it's false
But did I ever tell you, by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I never really heard you laugh

ABBA,Slipping Through My Fingers,Pop,"Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did but most we didn't
And why I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers...

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile...",282,45

You don't know how many times

To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what seems to be
The life that you could cherish as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters,
just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are driving me out of my mind
Oh, I could say I need you,
but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they loved you with all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face,
your hands and gaze into your eyes

I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
and say hello;

Little did I know
That you were Romeo; you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
And I was crying on the staircase,
begging you, 'Please, don't go.'""

And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes; escape this town for a little while.
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet,""
But you were everything to me; I was begging you, 'Please, don't go,'""

And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'

Romeo save me - they're tryin' to tell me how to feel;
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid; we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a life story - baby just say ""Yes.'""

Oh.

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever comin' around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town,

And I said,
""Romeo save me - I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in thy head? I don't know what to think-""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said, 
""Marry me, Juliet - you'll never have to be alone.
I love you and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress;
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'""

my cinnamon girl

Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his Cinnamon girl

A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
you see us together
chasing the moonlight
my cinnamon girl


Ma send me money
Now I'm gonna make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah...yeah...yeah.....

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl.......",119,30
The Beach Boys,Catch A Wave - Stereo/Remastered 2001,Pop,"Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world

Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
Everybody tries it once
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long
All the surfers going strong
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon
And watch 'em they'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world

Catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world

So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
Every Saturday boy
But don't treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world

Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world",218,28
Taylor Swift,long story short,Pop,"We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
and say hello;

Little did I know
That you were Romeo; you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
And I was crying on the staircase,
begging you, 'Please, don't go.'""

And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes; escape this town for a little while.
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet,""
But you were everything to me; I was begging you, 'Please, don't go,'""

And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'

Romeo save me - they're tryin' to tell me how to feel;
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid; we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a life story - baby just say ""Yes.'""

Oh.

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever comin' around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town,

And I said,
""Romeo save me - I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in thy head? I don't know what to think-""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said, 
""Marry me, Juliet - you'll never have to be alone.
I love you and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress;
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'""

Oh, oh.

We were both young when I first saw you...",377,59
Lulu,To Sir with Love,Pop,"Don Black; Mark London.

Those schoolgirl days, of telling tales and biting nails are gone,
But in my mind,
I know they will still live on and on,
But how do you thank someone, who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try,

If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters,
That would soar a thousand feet high,
To Sir, with Love

The time has come,
For closing books and long last looks must end,
And as I leave,
I know that I am leaving my best friend,
A friend who taught me right from wrong,
And weak from strong,
That's a lot to learn,
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start,
But I, would rather you let me give my heart,
To Sir, with Love",149,24

Dio,Stand Up and Shout,Pop,"It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly

It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the fire
Stand up and shout-shout

You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl

You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the fire
Stand up and shout

You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again

You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire go on explode

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout",140,38
Shakira,She Wolf,Pop,"S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise

Then he lost his leg in Dallas
He was dancin' with a train

I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows
I can taste you on my lips and
Smell you in my clothes
Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies
You never know just how you look
Through other people's eyes.

Some will die in hot pursuit
In firey auto crashes
Some will die in hot pursuit
While sifting through my ashes
Some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountain
That is pouring like an avalanche comin' down the mountain.

While arguing in traffic
Flipper died a natural death
He caught a nasty virus
Then there was the ever present

Paulie caught a bullet

Watched the smoke curl in the mist

In a faraway place
The sun fell cold upon my face
The cracks in the ceiling spelt hell
Turned to the wall
Pulled the sheets around my head
Tried to sleep, and dream my way
Back to you again

Count the days
Slowly passing by
Step on a plane
And fly away
I'll see you then
As the dawnbirds sing
On a cold and misty morning

So never think I'll make you try to stay,
And maybe when you get back,
I'll be off,
To find another way

When after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know,
So take your gloves and get out,
Baby get out
While you can

When you go
And would you even turn to say,
I don't love you like I did yesterday

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating,
But baby when they knock you down and out
Is where you oughta stay

And after all the blood that you still owe
Another time was just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Baby, get up
While you can

When you go
And would you even turn to say
I don't love you like I did yesterday

Well come on, come on

When you go
Would you have the guts to say
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday

I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday

I don't love you
Like I loved you

In the teen full moon

No one could make me stop

A pair of little boys
A teenage girlfriend
Got her lot of scars
Somebody please make me stop
Ohhh please

You know, I have puberty rights
And I have puberty wrongs

And no one made me stop

Someone took me by the hand in the blue
Attracted by some force within it
If I could close my eyes,
I could get used to it
Around the corner where a puppet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence
where children play
Saw them dance where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
The car screeched in the sand
and dust
Feel encouraged -
just a car on it's side
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled it close by the buildin's side
In a room for forgotten youth
I could think
or let my senses slide
Turned on to a night with you
Find the place where my friends, won't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine
and I had no time to lose
Yeah looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark street,
the houses looked the same
Stopped and turned around,
held me to a game
I walked round and round,
you nailed me to a tree
Trying to find a way,
trying to find a way, to get out
For twelve windows stand in a row
Behind a wall
where a room to go
The light shined like a neon show
See the deep mellow warmth
of the glow
No place to stop,
no place to go
No time to lose,
have to keep on going
I guess they died some time ago
I guess they died some time ago
And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I have no time to lose

Days when I still felt alive

To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

the actions of your life contradict your words
the path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse
washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence
ignore the signs

Don't Push

Stolen from an African land
Chased out with a knife
With a face like Bob Marley and a mouth like a motor bike
Oh well the bars are always open and the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken the music goes all night

And it goes...
If i was Bob Marley I said could you be loved
If I was half pint I'd ball the lord up above
If I was Mike Tyson I'd look for a fight
If I was a Boomtown Rats I would be stayin up all night
IF I was the king I'd Rock out and get stupid dumb
If rhymes were valiums I'd be comfortably numb

If I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do,
I'd point that shit straight at the sky
and shoot heaven on down for you
Because the bars are always open, and the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night
And it goes...

I want a lover, but I can't find the time
I want a reason, but I can't find the rhyme
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford,
Just lay on the ground like I fell off my skateboard
Now a days as clear as you please,
strap with protection or strap with disease.
Laughter, it's free any time just call me

Racism is schism on a serious tip
You don't believe me than I'll come bust your lip.
I hear the mountain, It hard to climb
Rougher the rhythm and it must be sublime
Listen yellow lover yeah it right on time
We got cricket with the quickness and the bass line

Go and raid the sound and tell the people the news oh, hey
tell them reggae music is on the loose
Here i am from the place where the sun keeps
shine new style in a unique fashion
And good good vibes that keep on playin, playin

He's the motive and the conscience of the murderer (He can redeem your sin)

Here are the young men, well where have they been?
We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.

Where have they been?

Left a conscience blessed to kill

For each kiss is a cry we all lost
Though nothing is left to gain
But for the banshee that stole the grave
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

I sit and dwell on faces past
Like memories seem to fade
No colour left but black and white
And soon will all turn grey
But may these shadows rise to walk again
With lessons truly learnt
When the blossom flowers in each our hearts
Shall beat a new found flame

I dreamt I met with Behan
I shook him by the hand and we passed the time of day

He had but these few clear and simple words to say

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I have cursed, bled and sworn
Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me
But the rope always was slack
And now that I've a pile
I'll go down to the Chelsea
I'll walk in on my feet
But I'll leave there on my back

Because I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

Oh the words that he spoke
Seemed the wisest of philosophies
There's nothing ever gained
By a wet thing called a tear
When the world is too dark
And I need the light inside of me
I'll walk into a bar
And drink fifteen pints of beer

Iam going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going
Where streams of whiskey are flowing

I am going, I am going
Any which way the wind may be blowing

Attracted by some force within it

I could get used to it
Around the corner where a puppet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence
where children play
Saw them dance where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
The car screeched in the sand
and dust
Feel encouraged -
just a car on it's side
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled it close by the buildin's side
In a room for forgotten youth
I could think
or let my senses slide
Turned on to a night with you
Find the place where my friends, won't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine
and I had no time to lose
Yeah looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark street,
the houses looked the same
Stopped and turned around,
held me to a game
I walked round and round,
you nailed me to a tree
Trying to find a way,

I was chillin' at a party
Pinchin' girlie's asses
I was drinking recklessly

I know I did something
Lord what could it be?

And all my friends hate me

What am I doing here?

She may be a queen
She might be

Threw a bottle at the bouncer
Didn't think that he was cool
Pissed in someones drink
And threw a bike into a pool

Drivin' down the side walk

Joy/Disaster,My Loose - Demo August 2011,Punk,"I walked through city limits
Someone took me by the hand in the blue
Attracted by some force within it
If I could close my eyes,
I could get used to it
Around the corner where a puppet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence
where children play
Saw them dance where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
The car screeched in the sand
and dust
Feel encouraged -
just a car on it's side
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled it close by the buildin's side
In a room for forgotten youth
I could think
or let my senses slide
Turned on to a night with you
Find the place where my friends, won't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine
and I had no time to lose
Yeah looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark street,
the houses looked the same
Stopped and turned around,
held me to a game
I walked round and round,
you nailed me to a tree
Trying to find a way,
trying to find a way, to get out
For twelve windows stand in a row
Behind a wall
where a room to go
The light shined like a neon show
See the deep mellow warmth

I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections.
And in class I dreamed all day,
Of a rock 'n' roll weekend

And the girl in the front of the room,
So close yet so far y'know she never seemed to notice
That this silly schoolboy crush
Wasn't just pretend.

[Chorus:]
Life goes by so fast
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past;
Story of my life

And I went down my old neighborhood
The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to
And the pool hall I loved as a kid
Is now a Seven Eleven

I went downtown to look for a job
I had no training, no experience to speak of.
I looked at the holes in my jeans
And turned and headed back.

[Chorus]

Good times come and good times go,
I only wish the good times would last a little longer.
I think about the good times we had
And why they had to end.

So I sit at the edge of my bed
I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song.
Thinkin' 'bout what you're doin' now
And when you're comin' back.

The Smiths,Cemetry Gates - 2017 Master,Punk,"A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
I want to cry
You say: ""Ere thrice the sun hath done
salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose or poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'
There's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall
You say: ""Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
'Some dizzy whore', 1804
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted

A young girl hocks her wedding ring

Down the alley the icewagon flew
Picked up a stiff that was turning blue
The local kids were sniffin' glue

Down Rain Street

Father McGreer buys an ice cold beer
And a short for Father Loyola
Father Joe's got the clap again
He's drinking Coca-Cola
Down on Rain Street

Bless me Father I have sinned
I got pissed and I got pinned
And God can't help the state I'm in
Down on Rain Street

There's a Tesco on the sacred ground
Where I pulled her knickers down
While Judas took his measly price
And St Anthony gazed in awe at Christ
Down on Rain Street

I gave my love a goodnight kiss
I tried to take a late night piss
But the toiled moved so again I missed
Down Rain Street

I sat on the floor and watched TV
Thanking Christ for the BBC
A stupid fucking place to be
Down Rain Street

I took my Eileen by the hand
Walk with me was her command
I dreamt we were walking on the strand
Down Rain Street

That night Rain Street went on for miles
That night on Rain Street somebody smiled",219,45

I sat there nearly lifeless
An old man in the corner sang
Where the water lilies grow
And on the jukebox Johnny sang
About a thing called love
And it's how are you kid and what's your name
And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes

I looked at him he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While Ray and Philomena sang
Of my elusive dream
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
So drunk to hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes",262,41

Joy/Disaster,Secret - Demo July 2009,Punk,"I walked through city limits
Someone took me by the hand in the blue
Attracted by some force within it
If I could close my eyes,
I could get used to it
Around the corner where a puppet lay
Saw the place where she had a room to stay
A wire fence
where children play
Saw them dance where the body lay
And I was looking for a friend of mine
The car screeched in the sand
and dust
Feel encouraged -
just a car on it's side
Metallic blue turned red with rust
Pulled it close by the buildin's side
In a room for forgotten youth
I could think
or let my senses slide
Turned on to a night with you
Find the place where my friends, won't go
And I was looking for a friend of mine
and I had no time to lose
Yeah looking for some friends of mine
Down the dark street,
the houses looked the same
Stopped and turned around,
held me to a game
I walked round and round,
you nailed me to a tree
Trying to find a way,
trying to find a way, to get out
For twelve windows stand in a row
Behind a wall
where a room to go
The light shined like a neon show
See the deep mellow warmth
of the glow
No place to stop,
no place to go
No time to lose,
have to keep on going
I guess they died some time ago
I guess they died some time ago
And I was looking for a friend of mine
And I have no time to lose
Yeah, I was looking for a friend of mine",281,48
Green Day,Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),Punk,"Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With doubt the vicious circle
Turns and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.",246,58

When the wagons leave the city

Painted wagon of the morning
For the forest and futher on
Dusty roads where they´ve gone
Sometimes travelin´ through the darkness
Foreing faces by the wayside
At the summer comin´ home
Look as if they hadn´t known
And the desert that´s dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
All the sad was in their eyes

Oh the dancing and the singing
Oh the music when they play
Oh the fire that they saw there


Sometimes they found it
On the grave of no return
Sometimes they kept it
Pawnee shadow to possess him
Ofen lost in on the way
Sometimes ride inside of day
Oh the sad was in their eyes
Where the map was found
And the desert that´s dry

In a country town
And the desert that´s dry
Where the wagons boundOh the sad was in their eye

Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes,
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that--

I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.

You make love just like a woman, yes, you do

Don't leave another cornerstone

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I said, I shot the sheriff, Oh Lord
And they say it is a capital offense
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hear this

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Ev'ry time I plant a seed
He said, ""Kill it before it grows.""
He said, ""Kill them before they grow.""

And so, oh, now, now,
Read it in the news

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self defense
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Where was the deputy?
I said I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in self defense

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw Sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot, I shot him down
And I say, if I am guilty I will pay

I shot the sheriff, but I say, but I didn't shoot no deputy
Ooh, no, oh
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy
Ooo, ooo, ooh

Reflexes had the better of me
And what is to be must be

One day the bottom a-go drop out

Tonight as I stand inside the rain

That Baby's got new clothes

Have fallen from her curls.

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes,
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that--

I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.

You make love just like a woman, yes, you do

Blast off on their space ship
Million miles from reality
No care for you, no care for me

Give a little, give a little

But it's just another illusion
So before you check out your tide
Don't leave another cornerstone
Standing there behind
We've got to face the day
Ooh-we come what may
We the street people talking
We the people struggling

Now they are sitting on a time bomb
Now I know the time has come
What goes on up is coming on down
Goes around and comes around

Then you would look for yours on earth

Have fallen from her curls.

She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend

That Baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes,
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that--

I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.

All you got to do is keep it in, baby

And stir it up! Little darling, stir it up!
Come on and stir it up, oh, little darling, stir it up, yeah

No one in front of me and nothing behind
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes
I'm looking up into the sapphire tempered skies
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose
Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care but - things have changed.
This place ain't doin' me any good
I'm in the wrong town, I should've been in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancin' lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he got anythin' to prove
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care but - things have changed.
I've been walkin' forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right the world will explode
I'm tryin' to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can't win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Puttin' her in a wheelbarrow and wheelin' her down the street
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care but - things have changed.
I hurt easy, I just don't show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and miss Lucy they jumped in a lake
I'm not that eager to make a mistake

Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I've got my hands bound,
And my head down, and my eyes closed,
My throat's wide open.

I do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto others what has been done to you

I'm treading water,
I need to sleep a while.
My lamb and martyr,
You look so precious.
Won't you, won't you come a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this,
I can't stand to burn too long.
Released in sodomy.
For one sweet moment I am whole.

Do unto you now what has been done to me.
Do unto you now what has been done...

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.
Won't you, wont you come just a bit closer,
Close enough so I can smell you.
I need you to feel this.
I need this to make me whole.
Release in this sodomy.
For I am your witness that
Blood and flesh can be trusted.
I am your witness that
Blood and flesh can be trusted
And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind.

Got your hands bound, your head down,
Your eyes closed.
You look so precious now.

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit blood and cum on my hands.

I've come round full circle.
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon.
You look so precious...
You look so precious...
You look so precious...
You look so precious, now...
You look so precious...",297,53

Long as I got your love, You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life, I had no doubt in my mind

I know how much I lean on you, Only you can see
Changes that I've been through, Have left their mark on me
You've been as constant as the northern star, The brightest light that shines
It's been you, woman, right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything, I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you that everyday, I'm loving you so much more

Cause you believed in me through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me, You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams, I put them all behind
And it was you, woman, right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything, I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you that everyday, I'm loving you so much more

Procol Harum,Conquistador,Rock,"Conquistador your stallion stands
in need of company
and like some angel's haloed brow
you reek of purity
I see your armour-plated breast
has long since lost its sheen
and in your death mask face
there are no signs which can be seen

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador a vulture sits
upon your silver shield
and in your rusty scabbard now
the sand has taken seed
and though your jewel-encrusted blade
has not been plundered still
the sea has washed across your face
and taken of its fill

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador there is no time
I must pay my respect
and though I came to jeer at you
I leave now with regret
and as the gloom begins to fall
I see there is no, only all
and though you came with sword held high
you did not conquer, only die

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind",180,35

The coyote call, the howling winds wail

The nights we spent together riding on the range
Looking back it seems so strange

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Riding in the rodeo

I was took in Texas I did not know her name
Lord, all these southern girls seem the same
Down below the border in a town in Mexico
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo

Roll me over and turn me around
Let me keep spinning till I hit the ground
Roll me over and let me go
Running free with the buffalo

Roll me over, and I'll turn around
And I'll move my fingers, up and down
Up and down

It's okay amigo, just let me go
Ridin' here in the rodeo

Roll me over and turn me around

Come tomorrow, may be a soldier.
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

But will they still be seen?
When time and tide have been.
Fall into your passing hands.

Don't make them desert sands.

With a gun in his hand

With the hair colored yellow,
Watcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you.""

I was scared and fearing for my life.
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree.
'Cause he was lean, mean,
Big and bad, Lord,
Pointin' that gun at me.
I said, ""Wait a minute, mister,
I didn't even kiss her.
Don't want no trouble with you.
And I know you don't owe me
But I wish you'd let me
Ask one favor from you.""

""Won't you give me three steps,
Gimme three steps mister,
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps mister,
And you'll never see me no more.""

And I began to pray
As the water fell on the floor.
And I'm telling you son,
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four.
Well he turned and screamed at Linda Lu
And that's the break I was looking for.
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door.

But desolate

So stale it kills
You strangle me

A tangle on the television and the magazine

D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?

Replace the kiss

Open your eyes and look at the day,
You'll see things in a different way.

Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.


Why not think about times to come,
And not about the things that you've done,
If your life was bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow will do.


Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,

On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

I'm not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Crapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I?
It's all gonna fade

Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years",151,35

Simon & Garfunkel,The Sound of Silence - Electric Version,Rock,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

&quot;Fools,&quot; said I, &quot;You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.&quot;
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, &quot;The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls, and whispered in the sounds of silence.&quot;",217,35

It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

Robin Trower,Man of the World - 2010 Remaster,Rock,"No such thing, I'm sure you've mistaken me.
If I'm your man, then give a last embrace.
Wish me well or help me solve this mystery,
I've taken my fill and packed it all into one suitcase.
Any other life,
Any other way.

Don't you worry about me
Or try to change how things are.
You've got to believe
That we're just worlds apart.

Can't talk now, and silence is too much to bear.
No great loss, but everything to gain.
Here's your home, I can lay down anywhere.
As time goes on, it seems like a fair exchange.
Any other life.
Any other way.

Don't you worry about me
It's all gone much too far

You sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous too.I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too. You know I love ya! Take care honey I know you're under a lot of pressure. See ya. Bye Bye!

-Verse 1
I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

-Chorus
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you

-Verse 2
I'm sober now for 3 whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with.
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again.
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I'll never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

-Chorus
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you

-Verse 3
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling ""Make it go away!""
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered ""How can you do this to me?""

-Chorus
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Elvis Presley,Lonesome Cowboy,Rock,"(Words &amp;amp; music: Roy Turk / Lou Handman)

Are you lonesome tonight,
do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you’re lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world’s a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I’ll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I’d rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I’m standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won’t come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down.

Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Sharing together, the magic of love In a world of our own

The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low

It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize
These things are clear to all from time to time

Talk talk talk talk
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us
But I know that I love you so
But I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds, they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient
Upon us, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain",181,28
Johnny Horton,When It's Springtime In Alaska (It's Forty Below),Rock,"(chorus)
Way up north to Alaska, way up north to Alaska
North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on.
North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on.

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of '92.
With George Pratt his partner, and brother Billy too.
They crossed the Yukon River, and found a bonanza gold.
Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome.
Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
He talked to his team of huskies as they mushed on through the snow.
With the Northern Lights a runnin' wild in the Land of the Midnight Sun.
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man in the year of nineteen-one.

Where the river is winding, big nuggets they're finding,
North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on.
(chorus)

George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand.
Said 'Sam you're a lookin' at a lonely, lonely man.
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of golden place on sweet little Jenny's hand.
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time.
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find.
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home.
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome.'

Where the river is windin', big nuggets they're findin'
North to Alaska, we've gone north, the rush is on.
North to Alaska, we've gone north, the rush is on.

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We can ride it together , ah ha
Making love with each other , ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other , ah ha
From one lover to another , ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together , ah ha
Making love with each other , ah ha

Jimmy Buffett,Cheeseburger In Paradise,Rock,"Tried to amend my carnivorous habit
Made it nearly seventy days
Losing weight without speed eating sunflower seeds
Drinking lots of carrot juice and soaking up rays
But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams
Some kind of sensuous treat
Not zucchini fettucini or bulgar wheat
But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat

Cheeseburger in paradise
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
Not too particular not too precise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

Heard about the oldtime sailor men
They'd eat the same thing again and again
Warm beer and bread they said could raise the dead
Well it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn
But times have changed for sailors these days
When I'm in port I get what I need
Not just havanas or banana or daiquiris
But that American creation on which I feed

Cheeseburger in paradise
Medium-rare with mustard'd be nice
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well good God almighty which way do I steer
For my...
Cheeseburger in paradise
Making the best of every virtue and vice
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice
To get a cheeseburger in paradise
Get me a cheeseburger in paradise

it’s the only thing that there's just too little of.

Lord, we don’t need another meadow,
there are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow,
there are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine,
oh listen Lord, if you want to know

What the world needs now is love sweet love:
it’s the only thing that there’s just too little of.
What the world needs now is love sweet love,

And I can't say if we're ever...
I can't say if we're ever gonna to be free

You see me now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last
And my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons and I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of
Did I hear you say that this is victory?

Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell
And been sliding into hell

To cry their troubles away

To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
Going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles away

The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget",100,21

Simon & Garfunkel,The Boxer,Rock,"I am just a poor boy.
Though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles,
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.

When I left my home
And my family,
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station,
Running scared,
Laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places
Only they would know.

Lie-la-lie...lie-le-lie-le-lie-le-lai.... lai-le-lai...........lai-le-lai-lelelelelai-lelelelelaiii

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job,
But I get no offers,
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare,
There were times when I was so
lonesome
I took some comfort there.

Lie-la-lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone,
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me,
Leading me,
Going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer,
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame,
""I am leaving, I am leaving.""
But the fighter still remains

Pink Floyd,Grantchester Meadows,Rock,"""Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain""
In the sky a bird was heard to cry.
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belie the deathly silence that lay all around.

Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea.

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down.
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground.
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.

Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees.

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down.
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground.
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.

Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees.",221,31
The Rascals,A Beautiful Morning - Single Version,Rock,"It's a beautiful morning
I think I'll go outside a while
and just smile.

Just take in some clean fresh air, boy
No sense in staying inside
If the weather's fine and you got the time
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day.

Either way
It's a beautiful morning
Each bird keeps singing his own song
So long, I've got to be on my way now.

No fun just hanging around, I've got to cover ground
You couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines
When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide
Still inside, shouldn't hide.

There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour

Seems to me that people keep seeing
more and more each day
Gotta say, lead the way
It's okay, brand new day
Gotta say, it's okay
Brand new day, gotta say, lead the way.

It's a Beautiful Morning!",161,32
