0,Mamie Smith,Keep A Song In Your Soul,Blues,"it's a junkie dream makes you so uptight
yeah it's halloween tonight and every night
see you scratch (see it on) your skin
your sandpaper throat
you're a symphony, man, with one fucking note
how they beat you up week after week
and when you grow up you're going to be a freak
want a violent girl who's not scared of anything
help me kill my time
'cause I'll never be fine
help me kill my time
you went down to look at old dallas town
where you must be sick just to hang around
seen it on tv how to kill your man
then like gacy's scene a canvas in your hand
you better call your mom she's out looking for you
in the jail and the army and the hospital too
but those people there couldn't do anything for you
help me kill my time
'cause I'll never be fine
help me kill my time
help me kill my time
help me kill my time
'cause I'll never be fine
help me kill my time"
1,Mamie Smith,Golfing Papa,Blues,"I know a triflin' man
They call him Triflin' Sam
He lives in Birmingham
Way down in Alabam'

Now the other night
He had a fight
With a gal named Mandy Brown
She plainly stated
She was aggravated
And she shouted out to him

Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
I said, don't two-time me
Aggravatin' papa, treat me kind or let me be
I mean, just let me be

It's been a while, I'll get you told
Stop messin' round, sweet jellyroll
If you stay out with a high-brown baby
I'll smack you down, and I don't mean maybe

Aggravatin' papa, I'll do anything you say
Anything you say
But when you go struttin', do your strut around my way
So papa, just treat me pretty, be nice and kind
The way you treated me will make me lose my mind
Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me

Just treat me pretty, be nice and sweet
I got a darn forty-four that don't repeat
Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me"
2,Mamie Smith,Don't You Advertise Your Man,Blues,"Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man

Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said ""it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care""

A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said ""return the rings""
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said ""it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care""
Oh, this charming man
Oh, this charming man

A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said ""return the ring""
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things"
3,Mamie Smith,Miss Jenny's Ball (aka There'll Be No Freebies At Miss Jenny's Ball),Blues,"I'll fake it through the day
with some help
from Johnny Walker red
Send the poisoned rain down the drain
to put bad thoughts in my head

Two tickets torn in half
and a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me--Miss Misery--
like you say you do?

A man in the park
read the lines in my hand
told me I'm strong, hardly ever wrong
I said man you mean

You had plans for both of us
that involved a trip out of town
to a place I've seen in a magazine
that you left lying around
I don't have you with me but
I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me--Miss Misery--
like you say you do?

I know you'd rather see me gone
than to see me the way that I am
but I am in your life, anyway

Next door TVs flashing blue
frames on the wall
It's a comedy of errors, you see;
it's about taking a fall
to vanish into oblivion
it's easy to do
and I try to be
but you know me I come back when you want me to
Do you miss me--Miss Misery--
like you say you do?"
4,Bessie Smith,Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out,Jazz,"I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or I die?

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or I die?

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
""Oh you've been in the house too long"", she said
And I naturally fled
In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
""Oh you've been in the house too long"", she said
And I naturally fled
In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or I die?"
5,Bessie Smith,'Tain't Nobody's Bizness If I Do,Jazz,"There ain't nothing I can do, or nothing I can say
That folks don't criticize me
But I'm goin' to, do just as I want to anyway
And don't care if they all despise me
If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do
If I go to church on Sunday
Sing the shimmy down on Monday
Ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
If my friend ain't got no money
And I say ""take all mine, honey""
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do
If I give him my last nickel
And it leaves me in a pickle
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
There are _________________ would hit me
Since _______________up and quit me

6,Bessie Smith,Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair,Jazz,"Judge you wanna hear my plea
Before you open up your court
But I don't want no sympathy
'Cause I done cut my good man's throat
I caught him whith a trifling Jane
I warned him 'bout before
I had my knife and went insane
And the rest you ought to know
Judge, judge, please mister judge,
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, good mister judge,
Let me go away from here
I wanna take a journey
To the devil down below
I done killed my man
I wanna reap just what I sow

Oh judge, judge, lordy lordy judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, hear me judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
I love him so dear
I cut him with my barlow (?)
I kicked him in the side
I stood here laughing o'r him
While he wallowed around and died
Oh judge, judge, lordy judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, sweet mister judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair
Judge, judge, good kind judge
Burn me 'cause I don't care
I don't want no one good mayor
To go my bail
I don't want to spend no
Ninety-nine years in jail
So judge, judge, good kind judge
Send me to the 'lectric chair"
7,Bessie Smith,Need a Little Sugar in My Bowl,Jazz,"One more little one
I'll go down
And stay down
And sleep the rest of the day

Dream new music
To calm down
And stay down
And keep evil away

I can hear you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream

As a new one appears
To take you along
Where you've never been

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Moonlight tonight

Seems to belong to me 'cause I
Even though soon can sleep
I need some company

One hit wouldn't hurt a bit
I'll slow down and sleep
The rest of the time

If it's good shit
You won't know
And I won't know
The fact that I'm dying

If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one

All things have a place
Under the moon
As well as the sun

One more little one I love you"
8,Bessie Smith,Young Woman's Blues,Jazz,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
'Cause, my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her
If it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis Blues
Blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

All by myself

12,Bessie Smith,Careless Love,Jazz,"Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope - no harm
Just another false alarm

Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope - no harm
Just another false alarm

So tell me how long
Before the last one?
And tell me how long
Before the right one?

This story is old - I KNOW
But it goes on
This story is old - I KNOW
But it goes on

It goes on..."

When the highbrows get together its just so right

Gets full of coin and starts breaking 'em down
And at the break of day
You can hear ol' Hannah say
'Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer.
Send me again. I don't care.
I feel just like I wanna clown.
Give the piano player a drink because he's bringing me down!
He's gotta rhyme, yeah! When he stomps his feet.
He sends me right off to sleep.
Check all your razors and your guns.
We gonna be arrested when the wagon comes.
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer.
Send me cause I don't care.
Blame me cause I don't care.

17,Louis Armstrong,Lazy River,Jazz,"Up a lazy river by the old mill stream
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along
Blue skies up above everyone�s in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me

Up a lazy river where the Robin's song
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along
There are blue skies up above and as long as we're in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be
If you go up a lazy river with me
Ah said with me now goin' up that lazy river with me"
18,Louis Armstrong,I've Got The World On A String,Jazz,"I see trees of green, red roses too.
I see them bloom for me and you,
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue and clouds of white.
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by,
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I love you.""

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow,
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know.
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

The title held by me -- M.I.B.
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there

Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence

from the deepest of the darkest of night
on the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like BOOM black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no M.I.B.'s, can I please
do what we say that's the way we kick it
YanawhaImean?� I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense

Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze...

When that elevator starts its ride

Like a leaf thats caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and Im aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that Ive waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Of the sacred wunder-kind
You took me behind a dis-used railway line
And said: ""I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known""
And you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

These things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept
That ever stepped

I'm spellbound but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

These things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept
That ever stepped

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your room
They meant more to me
Than any, than any living thing on earth
They had more worth
Than any living thing on earth

Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind

You will leave me behind"

26,Louis Armstrong,Stardust,Jazz,"Sometimes I wonder
why, I spend Such lonely nights
dreaming of a song
That melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new,
And each kiss . an inspiration
Oooh but that was long ago
Now my consolation, is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale hums his fairy tale
of paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
Always In my heart it will remain baby
My stardust melody,
the memory of love's refrain,
and now the urle dusk of twilight time
steals acorss the dust of my heart- my heart!"
27,Louis Armstrong,When It's Sleepy Time Down South,Jazz,"We have all the time in the world

We need nothing more

Every step of the way will find us
With the cares of the world far behind us

We have all the time in the world
Just for love
Nothing more, nothing less
Only love

34,Louis Armstrong,Stardust,Jazz,"Sometimes I wonder
why, I spend Such lonely nights
dreaming of a song
That melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new,
And each kiss . an inspiration
Oooh but that was long ago
Now my consolation, is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale hums his fairy tale
of paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
Always In my heart it will remain baby
My stardust melody,
the memory of love's refrain,
and now the urle dusk of twilight time
steals acorss the dust of my heart- my heart!"
35,Louis Armstrong,My Sweet,Jazz,"I just found joy
I'm as happy as a baby boy
With another brand-new choo-choo toy
When I'm with my sweet Lorraine

A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer skies
When you see them you will realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

I'm so happy
When it's rainin' I don't miss the sun
For it's in my sweetie's smile
Just to think that I'm the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can't wait until that happy day
When I marry sweet Lorraine

When it's rainin' I don't miss the sun
For it's in my sweetie's smile, baby
Just to think that I'm the lucky one
Who's will lead her down the aisle

Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can't wait until that lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine"

39,Louis Armstrong,I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me,Jazz,"I can't give you anything but love, Baby,
That's the only thing I've plenty of, Baby.
Dream awhile, scheme awhile, We're sure to find,
Happiness, and I guess, All those things you've always pined for.
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, Baby,
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, Baby.
Till that lucky day, you know darned well, Baby,
I can't give you anything but love."
40,George Olsen,A Sun-Kist Cottage In California,Jazz,"I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed the way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blind by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

(Ladies &amp; gentleman Mr. Elton John)
I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal oh

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see yeah

42,George Olsen,The Slave of Love,Jazz,"He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.

I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.

(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.

(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...

(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd verse, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th verse ''I went to see my
friend today may be found saying ''I went to see him just today'')"
43,Bessie Smith,Work House Blues,Jazz,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
'Cause, my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her
If it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis Blues
Blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint'n rye
I love my man till the day I die

44,George Olsen,Save Your Sorrow For Tomorrow,Jazz,"We've got to save the world
Someone else may want to use it
So far we've seen
This planet's rape, how we've abused it
We've got to save the world

The Russians have the biggest share
With their long fingers everywhere
And now they've bombs in outer space
With laser beams and atomic waste

Rain forest chopped for paper towels
One acre gone in every hour*
Our birds and wildlife all destroyed
To keep some millionaires employed

We've got to save the whale
Greenpeace they've tried to diffuse it
But dog food salesmen
Persist on kindly to harpoon it
We've got to save the world

The armament consortium
They're selling us plutonium
Now you can make your own H-bomb
Right in the kitchen with your mom

The nuclear power that costs you more
Than anything you've known before
The half-wit's answer to a need
For cancer, death, destruction, greed

We've got to save the world
Someone's children they may need it
So far we've seen
The big business of extinction bleed it
We've got to save the world

We're at the mercy of so few
With evil hearts determined to
Reduce this planet into hell
Then find a buyer and make quick sale

To end upon a happy note
Like trying to make concrete float
Is very simple knowing that
God in your heart lives

We've got to save the world
Someone else may want to use it
It's time you knew
How close we've come
We're gonna lose it - We gotta save, we gotta save
We gotta save the world"
45,George Olsen,Nobody Knows What a Red-Head Mama Can Do,Jazz,"Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though i went through some nights

Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow i made it through the heartache
Yes i did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (i know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep i didn't falter
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was !ow it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire i kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment, no i don't looking hack
When i think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (i know you do), i just laugh

When the river was deep i didn't fairer
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we snared was meant to be
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting , knew you were waiting for me"
46,George Olsen,My Papa Doesn't Two-Time No Time,Jazz,"These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time"

49,George Olsen,He's the Hottest Man In Town,Jazz,"I'm not the hero who will always save the day.
Don't always wear the white hat, don't always know the way.
I may not even be the dream you wanted to come true,
But I'll always be the man in love with you.
I'm not the key that opens every door.
I don't have the power to give you all you want and more,
But when you're needin' somethin' special you can hold on to,
I'll always be the man in love with you.

I never could work miracles.
There may be others who can do what I can't do,
But no one else can be as good as me at lovin' you.
So when the world won't turn the way you wish it would,
And the dreams you have don't come alive as often as they should,
Remember that there's someone there whose heart is always true.
I'll always be the man in love with you.

Remember that there's someone there whose heart is always true,
Someone there to help you make it through.
I'll always be the man in love with you."
50,George Olsen,Say Arabella - What's A Fella To Do,Jazz,"I love words. I thank you for hearing my words.
I want to tell you something about words that I think is important.
They're my work, they're my play, they're my passion.
Words are all we have, really. We have thoughts but thoughts are fluid.
then we assign a word to a thought and we're stuck with that word for
that thought, so be careful with words. I like to think that the same
words that hurt can heal, it is a matter of how you pick them.
There are some people that are not into all the words.
There are some that would have you not use certain words.
There are 400,000 words in the English language and there are 7
of them you can't say on television. What a ratio that is.
399,993 to 7. They must really be bad. They'd have to be outrageous
to be seperated from a group that large. All of you over here,you 7,
Bad Words. That's what they told us they were, remember?
""That's a bad word!"" No bad words, bad thoughts, bad intentions,
and words. You know the 7, don't you, that you can't say on television?
""Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, CockSucker, MotherFucker, and Tits""
Those are the heavy seven. Those are the ones that'll infect your soul,
curve your spine, and keep the country from winning the war.
""Shit, Piss, Fuck, Cunt, CockSucker, MotherFucker, and Tits""
Wow! ...and Tits doesn't even belong on the list. That is such a friendly
sounding word. It sounds like a nickname, right? ""Hey, Tits, come here,
man. Hey Tits, meet Toots. Toots, Tits. Tits, Toots."" It sounds like a
snack, doesn't it? Yes, I know, it is a snack. I don't mean your sexist
snack. I mean New Nabisco Tits!, and new Cheese Tits, Corn Tits,
Pizza Tits, Sesame Tits, Onion Tits, Tater Tits. ""Betcha Can't Eat Just
One."" That's true. I usually switch off. But I mean, that word does
not belong on the list. Actually none of the words belong on the list,
but you can understand why some of them are there. I'm not
completely insensetive to people's feelings. I can understand why
some of those words got on the list, like CockSucker and
MotherFucker. Those are heavyweight words. There is a lot going on
there. Besides the literal translation and the emotional feeling.
I mean, they're just busy words. There's a lot of syllables to contend
with. And those Ks, those are agressive sounds. They just jump out at
you like ""coCKsuCKer, motherfuCKer. coCKsuCKer, motherfuCKer.""
It's like an assualt on you. We mentioned Shit earlier, and 2 of the
other 4-letter Anglo-Saxon words are Piss and Cunt, which go
together of course. A little accedental humor there. The reason that
Piss and Cunt are on the list is because a long time ago, there were
certain ladies that said ""Those are the 2 I am not going to say. I
don't mind Fuck and Shit but 'P' and 'C' are out."", which led to such
stupid sentences as ""Okay you fuckers, I'm going to tinckle now.""
And, of course, the word Fuck. I don't really, well that's more
accedental humor, I don't wanna get into that now because I think
it takes to long. But I do mean that. I think the word Fuck is a very
imprortant word. It is the beginning of life, yet it is a word we use to
hurt one another quite often. People much wiser than I am said,
""I'd rather have my son watch a film with 2 people making love
than 2 people trying to kill one another. I, of course, can agree. It is
a great sentence. I wish I knew who said it first. I agree with that but
I like to take it a step further. I'd like to substitute the word Fuck for
the word Kill in all of those movie cliches we grew up with. ""Okay,
Sherrif, we're gonna Fuck you now, but we're gonna Fuck you slow.""
So maybe next year I'll have a whole fuckin' ramp on the N word.
I hope so. Those are the 7 you can never say on television, under any
circumstanses. You just cannot say them ever ever ever. Not even
clinically. You cannot weave them in on the panel with Doc, and Ed,
and Johnny. I mean, it is just impossible. Forget tHose 7. They're out.
But there are some 2-way words, those double-meaning words.
Remember the ones you giggled at in sixth grade? ""...And the cock
CROWED 3 times"" ""Hey, tha cock CROWED 3 times. ha ha ha ha. Hey, it's in
the bible. ha ha ha ha. There are some 2-way words, like it is okay for
Kirk Youdi to say ""Roberto Clametti has 2 balls on him."", but he can't
say ""I think he hurt his balls on that play, Tony. Don't you? He's holding
them. He must've hurt them, by God."" and the other 2-way word that
goes with that one is Prik. It's okay if it happens to your finger. You
can prik your finger but don't finger your prik. No,no."

Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together
I am so happy baby
Now that you are my lady
We can hold hands together
Every day, come what may
I promise you I'll
Always give you my lovin' always

Day time, night time
Your time, my time
Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together never felt like this before
Gettin' together is better than ever
Gettin' together

You bring me new excitement
I never knew what night meant
We got a thing together very few ever know
You can be sure of one thing
All of the love that I bring
I'm gonna keep you happy
All the time rain or shine
You're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it
Day time, night time
Your time, my time

Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleepin, it's a beatin'
Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

Oh help me, please mama, I'm sick'ning
It's today that's the day of the plunge
Oh the gal I'm to marry
Is a bow-legged sow
I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge

Don't ya worry, get dressed,cried my mother
As she plied me with bourbon so sour
Pull your socks up, put your suit on
Comb your long hair down,
For you will be wed in the hour

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
I'm sleepin, it's a beatin'
Can't ya please take it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

Oh help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
There's a pain where there once was a heart
It's sleepin, it's a beatin'
Can't ya please tear it out, and preserve it
Right there in that jar?

I was tremblin', as I put on my jacket
It had creases as sharp as a knife
I put the ring in my pocket
But there was a note
And my heart it jumped into my mouth

It read, Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you.
But I have no courage to speak to your face.
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
There be no wedding today.

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
You can put back my heart in its hole
Oh mama, I'm cryin'
Tears of relief
And my pulse is now under control"

I love to love pretty women
Any girl who'll join my pad
I love to love pretty women
Any girl who'll join my pad
I want to love pretty women
Till their hair turns back

I want women on my left, women on my right
Women all day, women all night
I want to love pretty women

Will never disappear.
I've seen that road before,
It always leads me here, lead me your door
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road.
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Don't leave me waiting here (don't keep me waiting)
Let me know the way"

Him: With a new heart, a brand-new start
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

One of those things

Fall into my arms
I feel your kiss
All around my face

That she only makes
And I

No I don't want your I.D.

Oh yeah, don'tcha scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that.

You look so weird and you're so far from home
But you don't really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm no mad-brained bear
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime
Oh, yeah
Woo!

I bet your mama don't know that you scatch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that.

You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs
If she's so wild then she can join in too
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

To feel her flaxen hair

72,Ethel Waters,Hottentot Potentate - Live,Jazz,"When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers
Who would hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives"

Just be aware, that you'll have to share

1-I want your love, I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart, so don't you fight
I'll be your answer, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy, your favorite dish

2-From the back to the middle and around again
I'm gonna be there til the end
100% pure love

Since my baby left this town
Sunshinin' all day long
But the rain keep comin' down
She's my life I need her so
Why she left I just don't know
Forty days and forty nights
Since I set right down and cried
Keep rainin' all the time
But the river is runnin' dry
Lord help me it just ain't right
I love that girl with all-a my might
Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby broke my heart
Searchin' for her in a while
Like a blind man in the dark
Love can make a poor man rich
Or break his heart I don't know which
Forty days and forty nights
Like a ship out on the sea
Prayin' for her each night
That she would come back-a home to me
Life is love and love is right
I hope she come back home tonight"
76,Jelly Roll Morton,Black Bottom Stomp,Jazz,"I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Hmm, hmm, hmm...

I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah!"

78,Fats Waller,Two Sleepy People,Jazz,"Here we are
Out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are
In the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest
And get a bit of rest

Well, here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight"

You just have to touch my cup.
You're my sugar.
It's sweeter when you stir it up.

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
seems the honey fairly drips.

But it looks like they've been foolin' you again
You thought that you'd got me all steaked out
But baby looks like I've been breaking out

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped from out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Looking for the source
I'm a dark horse

You thought you had got me in your grip
Baby looks like you was not so smart
And I became too slippery for you
But let me say that was nothing new

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I picked up my first spoon
I've been a cool jerk
Looking for the source
I'm a dark horse

I thought that you knew it all along
Until you started getting me not right
Seems as if you heared a little late
But I warned you when
We both were at the starting gate

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped from out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Who's looking for his perks
I'm a dark horse

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped from out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Cooking at the source
I'm a dark horse"
82,Fats Waller,The Joint Is Jumpin',Jazz,"They have a new expression along old Harlem way,
That tells you when a party is ten times more than gay:
To say that things are jumpin' leaves not a single doubt,
That everthing is in full swing when you hear someone shout.
Here 'tis:

The joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
Come in, cats, and check your hats,
I mean this joint is jumpin'!

The piano's thumpin',
The dancers are bumpin',
This here spot is more than hot,
In fact, the joint is jumpin'!

Check your weapons at the door,
Be sure to pay your quarter,
Burn your leather on the floor,
Grab anybody's daughter.

The roof is rockin',
The neighbors knockin',
We're all bums when the wagon comes,
I mean, this joint is jumpin'!

[Spoken]
Let it be! Yas!
Burn this joint, boy!
Yas!
Oh, my! Yas!
Don't you hit that chick, that's my broad!
Where'd you get that stuff at?
Why, I'll knock you to your knees!
What?
Put this cat out of here!
What?
Get rid of that pistol! Get rid of that pistol! Yeah! Get rid of it, yas!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talkin' about! Ha, ha! Yas!
Now it's really ready!
No, baby, not now, I can't come over there right now.
Yeah, let's do it!
[Party noises and shouting]

The joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin'!
Every Mose is on his toes,
I mean this joint is jumpin'!

[Police whistle]

Uh-oh! No time for talkin',
This place is walkin', yes,
Get your jug and cut the rug,
I think the joint is jumpin'.
Listen!

Get your pig feet, bread and gin,
There's plenty in the kitchen!
Who is that that just came in?
Just look at the way he's switchin'!

[Spoken]
Aw, mercy,
Don't mind the hour,
I'm in power.
I've got bail if we go to jail.
I mean this joint is jumpin'!

91,Uncle Bunt Stephens,Sail Away Lady - 2020 Remaster,Folk,"JOANNE:
Here's to the ladies who lunch--
Everybody laugh.
Lounging in their caftans
And planning a brunch
On their own behalf.
Off to the gym,
Then to a fitting,
Claiming they're fat.
And looking grim,
'Cause they've been sitting
Choosing a hat.
Does anyone still wear a hat?
I'll drink to that.

And here's to the girls who play smart--
Aren't they a gas?
Rushing to their classes
In optical art,
Wishing it would pass.
Another long exhausting day,
Another thousand dollars,
A matinee, a Pinter play,
Perhaps a piece of Mahler's.
I'll drink to that.
And one for Mahler!

And here's to the girls who play wife--
Aren't they too much?
Keeping house but clutching
A copy of LIFE,
Just to keep in touch.
The ones who follow the rules,
And meet themselves at the schools,
Too busy to know that they're fools.
Aren't they a gem?
I'll drink to them!
Let's all drink to them!

And here's to the girls who just watch--
Aren't they the best?
When they get depressed,
It's a bottle of Scotch,
Plus a little jest.
Another chance to disapprove,
Another brilliant zinger,
Another reason not to move,
Another vodka stinger.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
I'll drink to that.

So here's to the girls on the go--
Everybody tries.
Look into their eyes,
And you'll see what they know:
Everybody dies.
A toast to that invincible bunch,
The dinosaurs surviving the crunch.
Let's hear it for the ladies who lunch--
Everybody rise!
Rise!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!
Rise!"

'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day
And Friday I get my pay

Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone away
Got my money and my honey
And I'm out on the stand to play

Sunday mornin' my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time that I had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a mess"

Show Big-Pun love! Uh!

I don't give a fuck about'cha faults, or mishappenins, nigga.
We from Da Bronx, New York... Shit happens.
Kids clappin, luv ta spark da place.
Half da niggaz in 'da squad got a scar on dey face.

It's a cold world, and dis is ice.
Half a mill' for da charm, nigga, dis is life.
Got 'da Phantom in front of da buildin, Trinity Ave.
Ten years been legit, dey still figure me bad.

As a youngin, I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me &quot;Cook Coke&quot; shit.
Should'a been called Don Robbery,
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny.

I did it all, I put 'da pieces to da puzzle.
Just as long, I knew me and my peoplez was gonna' bubble.
Came out da gate on some Flow-Joe shit.
Fat nigga with da shotty was &quot;The Logo Kid&quot;.

[Chorus]
Said my niggaz dont dance,
We just pull up our pants and,
Do da Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

And I just bought a bike, so I can ride till I die,
Wit' a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,

My niggas in 'da club, but you know 'dey not dancin'.
We gANGSTA, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here,
Wit' burners 'n hoodies.

Listen, we don't pay admission,
And da bouncers dont check us,
And we walk around 'da metal detectors.

And there really aint a need for a VIP section,
In 'da middle of da dance floor,
Reckless; Check it!

Said He Like my necklace, started relaxin now,
Dats what da fuck I call a chain reaction.

See, money aint a thang nigga,

Now we 'bout'ta change 'da game, nigga.

If 5-0 boy come, then they'd prod'lly squeel.
'Cause half 'deez rappers did blow like Derek, fo'real.

If you cross 'da line, damn right I'm gonna hurt'chu.
These faggot niggaz even made gang-signs commercial.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,

I want a sensible and normal girl

Whenever I think I got my life in order
I meet a borderline girl who just crossed the border
but I can't see there's anything wrong with her
but she's a nutcase baby she's a crazy girl

Gonna run run run but I don't know where
gonna run run run but I'll see you there
gonna run run run I am never gonna get away
gonna run run run baby where can I go
gonna run run run well I just don't know
gonna run run run I am never gonna get away

Don't wanna be no guitar man
don't wanna be no singer in a rocking band
don't wanna drink no more spirits and wine
and don't want no shrink to read between my lines

There's gotta be a way out of here
there's gotta be a way to stop the ringing in my ears
there's a real thin line between me and apes
there's a real thin line I'm gonna try to escape

Gonna run run run...

I just wanna be an ordinary man
I wanna live my life as quit as I can
don't want no crazy woman to rule my world
I want a sensible and normal girl

Every time I think I'm back on my feet
she's a driveway that don't go all the way to the street
I gotta get out, gotta get out of here
gotta get out cause I don't want you near

Gonna run run run...

Gonna run run run..."
100,Fats Waller,"Blue, Turnin' Grey Over You",Jazz,"Blue Monday how I hate Blue Monday
Got to work like a slave all day
Here come Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday
I'm so tired got no time to play

Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks
My gal calls, got to tell her that I'm out
'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day
And Friday I get my pay

Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone away
Got my money and my honey
And I'm out on the stand to play

Sunday mornin' my head is bad
But it's worth it for the time that I had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a mess"
101,George Olsen,A Little Bit Bad,Jazz,"On the day I was born
The nurses all gathered 'round

102,George Olsen,Journey's End,Jazz,"I got sent home from school one day
With a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When Dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees
And waited for the worst

He said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
He said, ""Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then, It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""

When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy
Was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience
Had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him

I said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
I said, ""Daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen""

Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done
They'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard those words again

They said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see, daddies don't just love their children
Every now and then It's a love without end, amen
It's a love without end, amen"""
103,Ella Fitzgerald,All My Life - Live,Jazz,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
Through jazz and cocktails

The girls there all had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there; you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o' clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
But, oh I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts would only be a bore

A week in Paris would ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it.
I'll forget you I will
While yet you are still
burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive

And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
of those whose lifes are lonely too."
104,Dock Boggs,Sugar Baby - 2020 Remaster,Folk,"Oh I've got no sugar baby now
All I can do is to seek peace with you
And I can't get along this a-way
Can't get along this a-way

All I can do, I've said all I can say
I'll send it to your mama next payday
Send you to your mama next payday.

I got no use for the red rockin' chair,
I've got no honey baby now
Got no sugar baby now

Who'll rock the cradle, who'll sing the song
Who'll rock the cradle when I'm gone
Who'll rock the cradle when I'm gone?
I'll rock the cradle, I'll sing the song
I'll rock the cradle when you gone.

It's all I can do
It's all I can say,
I will send you to your mama next payday

Laid her in the shade, give her every dime I made
What more could a poor boy do
What more could a poor boy do?

Oh Ive got no honey baby now
Got no sugar baby now

Said all I can say, I've done all I can do
And I cant make a living with you
Can't make a living with you"
105,Blind Willie Johnson,"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground",Folk,"You had not've fallen then I would not've found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around awhile
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away for love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground

If I can't find her in West Helena, she must be in East Monroe, I know

I don't want no woman, wants every downtown man she meet
I don't want no woman, wants every downtown man she meet
She's a no good doney, they shouldn't 'low her on the street

I believe, I believe I'll go back home

The mood rings, the bracelets and the beads

You don't dream for me, no
You don't dream for me, no

Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted yeah
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
And certain situations scream for deviations
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle
Of this and that and man he should try less
Every time he's rejected man he loses affection

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing
But still find some to spare
And other people got more than they could use
But they don't share
And some people got problems man
They got awful complications
Other people got perfect situations
With no provocation

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you
Confused

110,Blind Willie Johnson,Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed,Folk,"Close to insanity
beyond the realms I've been
at darkest places
I'm crying
""The dragon flies""

Something savage
is yearning for me
I'm waiting afraid for the night
what will be
I've lost myself
a few days ago
it's touching my soul
and a vision of past dreams comes true

Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't You see the dragon's seed bears in me

the one who's been before
many times I terrorized this town
many times and here I start again
now I'm stronger and so cold
cold as ice
returning is my destiny
now I feel it's growing up in me
now I feel it's burning deep in me
I'm not what I was before
could I stop this dream
I'm a stranger to myself
and I cannot control

Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Welcome to dying
The dragon's breath I don't let it out

I'm a savage
it's too late for me
the other side's taking controll and I know
there's one way I can walk alone
or the dragon will fly
and a growing fear's all that I feel

Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't You see the dragon's seed bears in me

Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me

Spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away"
111,Blind Willie Johnson,Lord I Just Can't Keep From Crying,Folk,"In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain.

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In the land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain."

This time I know I'm bound to spit it back up
I didn't want this salty substitute
Just not going to do, I need some air
If I'm going to live through
This experience reminds me of a clock that just won't tick

I want to wake up from this concussion
But my dream is just not done - I'm late again
It's just one of those bad days
Look outside and peek out for what you ride you just might find
That you're out of time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough I'll be home

He's got illusions between his ears, man, takes up too much space
And all that tension between his gears, man, he never ever leave this place
He's got stones instead of bones and everybody knows
Aw, man, that can make you real real slow
And if heaven were below, you'd know just where to go
Dive in the ocean and he'd sink like a stone
And he said, it's time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough I'll be home

Hold on if you can, you're going to sink faster than you can imagine so
Hold on if you can, you're going to sink faster than you can imagine so

It's just time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough I'll be home"

When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you
I'll take your part, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, if you need a friend

A hundred thousand centuries

so near but so much too far

but you're immortal

like a hawk in the sky
a wonder that dies

I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain

Alive
Though the end appears my friend

And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand

My mind's
In frozen dreams
The rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one ever will

Can't hold it
It burns
Each night I cry in pain

And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside

It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
In blame

And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain

And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
Cut off your old friends hand"

The guards who had been a-watching, asleep 'cause they were tired
When they heard the great excitement, then a gunshot was fired

Captain Smith gave orders, women and children first
Many of the lifeboats piled right up, many were liable to crush
God moves on, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray

So many had to leave their happy home, all that they possess
Lord Jesus, will you hear us now, help us in our distress
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, people had to run and pray
Women had to leave their loving ones, see 'bout their safety
When they heard the liner was doomed, hearts did almost break
God moves, God moves, God moves, ah, and the people had to run and pray
A.G. Smith, mighty man, built a boat that he couldn't understand

Instead, Im stuck here rubbin these fenders with a rag
And walkin home in soggy old shoes
With them steadily depressin, low down mind messin
Workin at the car wash blues

You know a man of my ability
He should be smokin on a big cigar
But till I get myself straight I guess Ill just have to wait
In my rubber suit a-rubbin these cars

Well, all I can do is a shake my head
You might not believe that its true
For workin at this end of niagara falls
Is an undiscovered howard hughes
So baby, dont expect to see me
With no double martini in any high-brow society news
Cause I got them steadily depressin, low down mind messin
Workin at the car wash blues
So baby, dont expect to see me
With no double martini in any high-brow society news
Cause I got them steadily depressin, low down mind messin
Workin at the car wash blues
Yeah I got them steadily depressin, low down mind messin
Workin at the car wash blues"
125,Paul Whiteman,Get Out and Get Under the Moon,Jazz,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon"
126,Benny Goodman,Goodbye,Jazz,"Evry Time We Say Goodbye
Benny Goodman
Music and Lyrics by Cole Porter
From Seven Lively Arts

Evry time we say goodbye I die a little.
Evry time we say goodbye I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know,
Think so little of me they allow me to go.
When you're near there's such a joy of spring about it.
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it.
there's no love song finer,
But how strange the change from major to minor
Evry time we say goodbye.
Evry single time we say goodbye"
127,Leroy Carr,"How Long, How Long Blues",Blues,"Here am I with you,
In a world of blue,
While we're dancing to
The tango we loved when first we met.
While the music plays,
I recall the days,
When our love was a tune
That we couldn't soon forget.
As I kiss your cheek,
We don't have to speak,
The violins like a choir,
Express the desire we used to know,
Not long ago.
So just hold me tight,
In your arms tonight,
And the blue tango will be,
Our thrilling memory of love.

Time enough for life to unfold
All the precious things love has in store
We have all the love in the world
If that's all we have, you will find
We need nothing more

Every step of the way will find us
With the cares of the world far behind us

We have all the time in the world
Just for love
Nothing more, nothing less
Only love

For you I sigh, for you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?

I spend my days in longin'
And wond'ring why it's me you're wrongin'
I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you, body and soul

131,Mississippi John Hurt,Nobody's Dirty Business,Folk,"I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshots in your pants if you step into my yard

When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs

I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down scrub her back
And turn her inside out
`Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years

Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped"

133,Mississippi John Hurt,Frankie,Folk,"Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
she paid one hundred dollars for Albert's suit of clothes
He's her man, but he did her wrong

Frankie went down to the corner saloon, she ordered her a glass of beer,
she asked the barkeeper, ""Gas my lovin' Albert been here?""
""He been here, but he's gone again""

""Ain't gonna tell you no story, Frankie, I ain't gonna tell you no lie""
Says, ""Albert a-passed about a hour ago, with a girl you call Alice Frye
He's your man, and he's doin' you wrong

Frankie went down to the corner saloon, she didn't go to be gone long
She peeked through keyhole in the door, spied Albert in Alice's arm
He's my man, and you's doin' me wrong

Frankie called Albert, she shot him three or four times,
says, ""Stand back, I'm smokin' my gun, let me see is Albert dyin'
He's my man, and he did me wrong""

Frankie and the judge walked outta the stand, and walked out side by side
The judge says, ""Frankie, you're gonna be justified,
killin' a man, and he did you wrong""

Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
she paid one hundred dollars for Albert's suit of clothes
He's her man, but he did her wrong

Said, ""Turn me over, mother, turn me over slow,
it may be my last time, you won't turn me no more

134,Louis Armstrong,(What Did I Do To Be So) Black And Blue,Jazz,"Won't you come and go with me
Down that Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Come along with me on, down to new orleans

Now the band�s there to greet us
Old friends will meet us
Where all them folks goin to the St. Louis cemetary meet
Heaven on earth, they call it basin street

I'm tellin� ya, basin street is the street
Where all them characters from the first street they meet
New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never miss them rice and beans
Way down south in New Orleans

They'll be huggin� and a kissin�
That's what I been missin�
And all that music lord, if you just listen�

135,Louis Armstrong,"Love, You Funny Thing",Jazz,"Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat,
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that,
Goodness knows what the end will be
Oh I don't know where I'm at
It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done:
You say either and I say either,
You say neither and I say neither
Either, either
Neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off.
You like potato and I like potahto
You like tomato and I like tomahto
Potato, potahto,
Tomato, tomahto.
Let's call the whole thing of
But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
and oh, if we ever part, then that might break my heart

So if you like pyjamas
and I like pyjahmas,
I'll wear pyjamas
and give up pyajahmas
for we know we need each other so
we better call the whole thing off
let's call the whole thing off.

You say laughter and I say larfter
You say after and I say arfter
Laughter, larfter
after arfter
Let's call the whole thing off,
You like vanilla and I say vanella
you saspiralla, and I saspirella
vanilla vanella
chocolate strawberry
let's call the whole thing of
but oh if we call the whole thing of
then we must part
and oh, if we ever part,
then that might break my heart

So if you go for oysters
and I go for ersters
I'll order oysters
and cancel the ersters
for we know we need each other
we better call the calling off off,
let's call the whole thing off.

I say father, and you say pater,
I saw mother and you say mater
Pater, mater
Uncle, auntie
let's call the whole thing off.

I like bananas and you like banahnahs
I say Havana and I get Havahnah
Bananas, banahnahs
Havana, Havahnah
Go your way, I'll go mine

So if I go for scallops
and you go for lobsters,
So all right no contest
we'll order lobseter
For we know we need each other
we better call the calling off off,
let's call the whole thing off."

And he keeps it, ah, out of sight
Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

On the sidewalk on Sunday mornin', don't you know
Lies a body just oozin' life
And someone's sneakin' round the corner
Could that be our boy Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag�s just a'drooppin' on down
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now MacHeath spends, he spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?

Now Jenny Diver, ho, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky�s back in town

why, I spend Such lonely nights
dreaming of a song
That melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new,
And each kiss . an inspiration
Oooh but that was long ago
Now my consolation, is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale hums his fairy tale
of paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
Always In my heart it will remain baby
My stardust melody,
the memory of love's refrain,
and now the urle dusk of twilight time
steals acorss the dust of my heart- my heart!"
141,Louis Armstrong,I've Got The World On A String,Jazz,"I see trees of green, red roses too.
I see them bloom for me and you,
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

I see skies of blue and clouds of white.
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by,
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I love you.""

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow,
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know.
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me

Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along

In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take Jello
You're calmer than the seals in the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins to express emotion

A fine romance, my dear Duchess
Two old fogies, we really need crutches
You're just as hard to land as the Ile de France! (Fronce)
I haven't got a chonce (chance), this is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good woman
My strong, aged-in-the-wood woman
You never give those orchids I send a glance
They're just like cactus plants, (oh boy)
This is a fine romance!"
178,Fred Astaire,They All Laughed,Jazz,"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned
They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world
was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when they said that
man could fly
They told Marconi wireless was a phony, it's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you, said I was reaching for the
moon
But oh, you came through, now they'll have to change their
tune
They all said we never could be happy, they laughed at us and
how!
But ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh now?
They all laughed at Rockefeller Center, now they're fighting to
get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat, Hershey and his
chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie, kept the laughers busy, that's how people
are
They laughed at me wanting you, said it would be, &amp;quot;Hello,
Goodbye.&amp;quot;
But oh, you came through, now they're eating humble pie
They all said we'd never get together, darling, let's take a
bow
For ho, ho, ho! Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee! Let's at the past laugh, Ha, ha, ha! Who's got
the last laugh now?"
179,Fred Astaire,Shall We Dance,Jazz,"I could dance nightly just holding you tightly my sweet.
I could keep right on because you're so light on youre feet.
You're easy to dance with.

There is no doubt in the way we stand out in the crowd.
Though it's called dancing to me it's romancing out loud.
You're easy to dance with.

Loving you the away I do makes you easy to dance with.
That is why I'm always right on the beat.
All those charms in one man's arms makes you easy to dance with.
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet.

Let's dance forever come on say we'll never be through,
It's so easy to dance with you.

Loving you the away I do makes you easy to dance with.
That is why I'm always right on the beat.
All those charms in one man's arms makes you easy to dance with.
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet.

So let's dance forever come on say we'll never be through,
It's so easy to dance with you."

But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore"

I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
Smile through your tears, laughing at liife
No road is lonely, if you will only
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Smile through your tears, laugh at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life"
184,Billie Holiday,Night and Day - Take 1,Jazz,"Like the beat, beat, beat,
Of the tom-tom;
When the jungle shadows fall,
Like the tick, tick, tock
Of the stately clock,
As it stands against the wall,
Like the drip, drip, drip,
Of the raindrops,
When the summer show'r is through;
So a voice within me
Keeps repeating,
You, you, you --

Night and day
You are the one,
Only you
Beneath the moon
And under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter,
Darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day.

Day and night
Why is it so,
That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom,
In the silence of my lonely room,
I think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an
Oh, such a hungry yearning,
Burning inside of me."
185,Billie Holiday,You Go to My Head - Take 1,Jazz,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself ""Get a hold of yourself""
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head"

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
Honey I get oh so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
Ain't no wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance"
189,Billie Holiday,Am I Blue? - Take 2,Jazz,"Lord I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some men like me talkin' happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs"
190,Billie Holiday,Ghost of Yesterday,Jazz,"Jerome Kern / Otto Harbach

Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free in flame and life
Then sooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I’m dreamin' of
Yesterdays

192,Billie Holiday,I Cover the Waterfront,Jazz,"Away from the city that hurts and mocks
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks.
In the still and the chill of the night.
I see the horizon, the great unknown.
My heart has an ache it says heavy stone.
Will the dawn come along and make it light?

I cover the waterfront;
I'm watching the sea.
Will the one I love be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront;
In search of my love,
and I'm covered by a starlit sky above

Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and longing
Oh, how I yearn!
Where are you?
Areyou forgetting?
Doyou remember?
Will you return?

I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to me.
For the one I love must soon come back to me."
193,Art Tatum,I Know That You Know - Live,Jazz,"I bruise you, you bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you, and that's all I know

All my plans have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you, and that's all I know

When the singer's gone
Let the song go on...

But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass to slow
I love you, and that's all I know

When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say the darkest night
There's a light beyond

But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast, but they pass too slow
I love you, and that's all I know
That's all I know
That's all I know"
194,Billie Holiday,Body and Soul,Jazz,"You're making me blue
All that you do
Seems unfair
You try not to hear
Turn a deaf ear
To my prayer
It seems you don't want to see
What you are doing to me
My arms are waiting to caress you
And to my heart they long to press you, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering it's me you're wronging
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I can't believe it
It hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending?
Don't say it's the ending
I wish I could have one more change to prove, dear
My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you
Body and soul

Life's dreary for me
Day's seem to be long as years
I've looked for the sun
But can see none
Through my tears
Your heart must be like a stone
To leave me like this alone
When you could make my life worth living
By taking what I'm set on giving, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul"

Iv'e been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good dose it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Even Gabel had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you

Can't get started with you"
197,Billie Holiday,Let's Call a Heart a Heart,Jazz,"It's that ole devil called love again
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Putting rain in my eyes
Tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart

It's that sly ole-sun-of-a-gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

Suppose I didn't stay and ran away
Wouldn't play
That devil-what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love

He'd follow around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do"

Feel tired like heavy stone
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Who will see and who will care
Bout this load that I must bear
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Prayers are said to heaven above
'bout my burdens,woes and love


Head bowed down with misery
Nothing now appeals to me
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

Give me just another day
There's one thing I want to say
Friends are well when all is gold
Leave you always when you're old
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone"
199,Billie Holiday,Let's Call the Whole Thing Off,Jazz,"A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
Still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin'words
That told you what my heart meant
A fair ground painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of march that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you"
200,Billie Holiday,When a Woman Loves a Man,Jazz,"It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore"

Still I want to hear it from you

Say it isn't so, say it isn't so
Ev'ryone is saying you don't love me
Say it isn't so

Ev'rywhere I go, ev'ryone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me
Say it isn't so

People say that you
Found somebody new

Say it isn't so"

Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me,
The way you looked when we meet
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.
I hear you whisper,
&quot;i'll always lave you&quot;
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.

So i must dream
To have your hand caress me,
Fingers press me tight.
I'd rather dream
Than have the lonely feeling
Stealing through the nigh.

Each little moment
Is clear before me,
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget."
210,Billie Holiday,He's Funny That Way - Take 1,Jazz,"Never had nothing
No one to care
That's why I seem to have
More than my share
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

When I hurt his feelings
Once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
End it all and let him go
To some better gal
But I'm only human
A coward at best
I'm more than certain
He'd follow me West
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way


Though he loves to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away
But why should I leave him
Why should I go
He'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way"
211,Billie Holiday,Did I Remember? - Take 1,Jazz,"Lorenz hart / richard rodgers

Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me,
The way you looked when we meet
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.
I hear you whisper,
&quot;i'll always lave you&quot;
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget.

So i must dream
To have your hand caress me,
Fingers press me tight.
I'd rather dream
Than have the lonely feeling
Stealing through the nigh.

Each little moment
Is clear before me,
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget."
212,Billie Holiday,Don't Know If I'm Comin' or Goin' - Take 1,Jazz,"Billy Rose / Edward Eliscu / Vincent Youmans

More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I've found you on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But darling, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry
How I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I show
More than you'll ever know"
213,Billie Holiday,Summertime,Jazz,"Summertime
and the livin' is easy
fish are jumpin
and the cotton is high

and your ma is good lookin'

One of these mornin's
you're goin' to rise up singin'

and you'll take to the sky

214,Billie Holiday,I Hear Music - Take 1,Jazz,"Duke ellington / bob russell

Some-one told some-one and some-one told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much,
Since ev'ryone spread the story
With his own little personal touch.

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head.
Do nothin' till you hear from me


At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you.
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will."
215,Billie Holiday,Night and Day - Take 2,Jazz,"Like the beat, beat, beat,
Of the tom-tom;
When the jungle shadows fall,
Like the tick, tick, tock
Of the stately clock,
As it stands against the wall,
Like the drip, drip, drip,
Of the raindrops,
When the summer show'r is through;
So a voice within me
Keeps repeating,
You, you, you --

Night and day
You are the one,
Only you
Beneath the moon
And under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter,
Darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day.

Day and night
Why is it so,
That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom,
In the silence of my lonely room,
I think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an
Oh, such a hungry yearning,
Burning inside of me."
216,Billie Holiday,No Regrets - Take 1,Jazz,"Harry Tobias / Ingraham

No regrets
Although our love affair has gone astray
No regrets
I know I'll always care though you're away
So now our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets

No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets"
217,Billie Holiday,"One, Two, Button Your Shoe",Jazz,"Fulton McGrath / Johnny Mercer

Mandy is two
You ought to see her eyes of cornflower blue
They really look as it they actually knew
That she's a big girl now

Mandy is two
You ought to see how many things she can do
She knows her alphabet
And ties her own shoes
And no one showed her how

If you could see her majesty
With braids in her hair
Almost as though her Sunday beau
Came around and brought her an orchid to wear

Mummy is blue
Because her little girl is going on three
But Miss Amanda she's as proud as can be
Cause she's a big girl now"

You only shutter
Cuz your poor tongue
Just won't utter the words

Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through

You'll get bold
You can't resist him

Sun showers
Never mind the rain
The sun will shine again
Through sun showers

In a little while
They sky above will srnile
Like luster that follows your kiss

Dark clouds of sorrow
Will soon be a sunny tomorrow

While sun flowers
Raise their happy eyes
Up to the flaming skies
Then sun showers
Leave us as they follow
Rainbows in our hearts

The gray skies soon will clear
My dear
While sun showers are here"

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs"

It's that sly ole-sun-of-a-gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

Suppose I didn't stay and ran away
Wouldn't play
That devil-what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love

Build me up, tear me down

I wouldn't know what to do"

You told me that I was like an angel
Told me I was fit to wear a crown
So that you could get a thrill
You put me on a pedestal
And then you let me down, let me down.

You told me that I'd be wearing diamonds
I would have the smartest car in town
Made me think that I'm the top
And then you let the ladder drop
You know you let me down, let me down

I walked upon a rainbow
I clung onto a star
You had me up in heaven
That's why I had to tall so far

I was even looking for a cottage
I was measured for a wedding gown
That how I got cynical
You put me on a pinnacle
And then you let me down, let me down
How you let me down"

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself ""Get a hold of yourself""
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head"

Say you're glad you found me
Put your arms around me
Before we part

Even though it's just pretending
And the night is almost through
I can say I'm only lending
When I give my heart to you

Let's dream in the moonlight
Let your lips touch mine
Though we're only dreaming tonight

Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby
And I've got to know the reason why
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""
But he only shook his head and said ""Goodbye""
He kept on walking down the avenue

Nobody wants me

More that one day's rest is wrong
You start restin' Sunday and rest so hard
You're tired the whole week long

It all came true
I wished on the moon for you"

Lonely, hurt I had not known which way to turn
'Til you said, ""Try smiles, not tears, just laugh and learn""

I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!
You made me see how lovely life could be
Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost
To find I'd gained, not lost!

When I thought that hope was really gone
You showed me I was wrong
And you taught me how to carry on
Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song!

I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!
I'd do the same for youif your turn came
Hope it never will
for I've been though the mill
I won't get this debt
I'm pulling trough"

247,Louis Armstrong,On The Sunny Side Of The Street,Jazz,"Won't you come and go with me
Down that Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Come along with me on, down to new orleans

Now the band�s there to greet us
Old friends will meet us
Where all them folks goin to the St. Louis cemetary meet
Heaven on earth, they call it basin street

I'm tellin� ya, basin street is the street
Where all them characters from the first street they meet
New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never miss them rice and beans
Way down south in New Orleans

They'll be huggin� and a kissin�
That's what I been missin�
And all that music lord, if you just listen�
New orleans, I got them basin street blues

Now ain't you glad you went with me
On down that Mississippi
We took a boat to the land of dreams
Heaven on earth they call it basin street"
248,Billie Holiday,Falling In Love Again - Take 2,Jazz,"The snow is snowin'
The wind is blowin'
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm"
249,Billie Holiday,I Hear Music - Take 2,Jazz,"Duke ellington / bob russell

Some-one told some-one and some-one told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much,
Since ev'ryone spread the story
With his own little personal touch.

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head.
Do nothin' till you hear from me


At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you.
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will."
250,Billie Holiday,Practice Makes Perfect - Take 3,Jazz,"If practice makes perfect
Let's try that old embrace
In some romantic place
Where we can take out time

Just close you eyes again
We'll try those sights again
And make them more sublime

We're in love's kindergarden
Learning from A to Z
And if it's fun just starting
Think what it's going to be

If practice makes perfect
Let's have that kiss again
We must'n miss again
We're not doing bad right now

We're not doing bad
Let's practice some more
We're not doing bad right now"

252,Billie Holiday,Under a Blue Jungle Moon - Take 2,Jazz,"Lord I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some men like me talkin' happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs"
253,Fred Astaire,Cheek to Cheek,Jazz,"Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.

Heaven, I'm in Heaven,
And the cares that hung around me thro' the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek.

Oh! I love to climb a mountain,
And to reach the highest peak,
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek.

Oh! I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek,
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek.

Dance with me
I want my arm about you;
The charm about you
Will carry me thro' to Heaven

I'm in Heaven,
and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak;
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek."
254,Fred Astaire,The Way You Look Tonight,Jazz,"Someday,
When I'm awfuly low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look, tonight

Oh but you're Lovely
With you smile so warm
And your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look, tonight

With each word you tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely,
Never never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love, you
Just the way you look, tonight
Just the way you look, tonight"

257,Fred Astaire,They Can't Take That Away from Me,Jazz,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away
Can't take that away
Can't take that away from me"
258,The Ink Spots,I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire,Jazz,"I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start
A flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you
No other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of
Believe me!

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start
A flame in your heart"
259,Fred Astaire,Let's Face The Music And Dance,Jazz,"I could dance nightly just holding you tightly my sweet.
I could keep right on because you're so light on youre feet.
You're easy to dance with.

There is no doubt in the way we stand out in the crowd.
Though it's called dancing to me it's romancing out loud.
You're easy to dance with.

Loving you the away I do makes you easy to dance with.
That is why I'm always right on the beat.
All those charms in one man's arms makes you easy to dance with.
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet.

Let's dance forever come on say we'll never be through,
It's so easy to dance with you.

Loving you the away I do makes you easy to dance with.
That is why I'm always right on the beat.
All those charms in one man's arms makes you easy to dance with.

&amp;quot;Your presence requested this evening,
It's formal, a top hat, a white tie and tails.&amp;quot;
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails.
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat and white tie and tails.

I'm puttin' on my top hat,
Tyin' up my white tie,
Brushin' off my tails.
I'm dudin' up my shirt front,
Puttin' in the shirt studs,
Polishin' my nails,
I'm steppin' out, my dear,
To breathe an atmosphere
That simply reeks with class;
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust
When I step on the gas,
For I'll be there,
Puttin' down my top hat,
Mussin' up my white tie,
Dancin' in my tails."
261,Fred Astaire,A Foggy Day,Jazz,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-toms
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
Night and day, day and night why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day, day and night
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you
Night and day, day and night"

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

&lt;very brief instrumental&gt;

Take a tip before you take your trip; let me tell you where to go,
Go to Engeland, Oh;

Don't mean to criticize, or say I'm wise,

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago
Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor


And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became the cry
Cause you remained in my heart, so
Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or lonely, lonely ashes of the flame, with you
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue"

You told me that I was like an angel
Told me I was fit to wear a crown
So that you could get a thrill
You put me on a pedestal
And then you let me down, let me down.

You told me that I'd be wearing diamonds
I would have the smartest car in town
Made me think that I'm the top
And then you let the ladder drop
You know you let me down, let me down

I walked upon a rainbow
I clung onto a star
You had me up in heaven
That's why I had to tall so far

I was even looking for a cottage
I was measured for a wedding gown
That how I got cynical
You put me on a pinnacle
And then you let me down, let me down
How you let me down"

I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love"

Tommy Dorsey
Music and Lyrics byJoe Buskin and John De Vries

Him: I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
Never cared much
Her: Oh look at you now

Him: I never knew the technique of kissing'
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
Never know much
Her: Oh look at you know

Her: You're a new man, better than
Casanova at his best
Him: With a new heart, a brand-new start
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

Her: So you're the guy who turned out a lover
Him: Yes I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Her: But look at you now

Chorus: He's not the guy who cared about love
And he's not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
Cared about much
But look at him now
Him: I'm a lover

Chorus: He never knew the technique of kissing'
He never knew the thrill he could get from her touch
Never knew much
But look at him now
Him: Man, I've really come on

Her: He's a new man, better than
Girls: Casanova at his best, bra-da
Her: With a new start, a brand-new heart
Men: He's so proud he's bustin' his vest

Chorus: So he's the guy who turned out a lover
So he's the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Him: But look at me now

Chorus: He's a new man, better than
Casanova at his best
He's got some new jive and it's really fine
Him: Boy, I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

Chorus: He's a lover, Yes, we know he's a lover, yes
Him: I laughed at those blue diamond rings
Just one of those things
Chorus: But look at him now
Him: Jack, I'm ready!
Chorus: Look at him now!

278,Billie Holiday,Am I Blue?,Jazz,"Lord I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some men like me talkin' happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs"

More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart, I love you so
Lately I've found you on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But darling, I can't live without it

Oh, how I'd cry
How I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I show
More than you'll ever know"

No regrets
Although our love affair has gone astray
No regrets
I know I'll always care though you're away
So now our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets

Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, Always knew what's goin on
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's done, been lazin' out in the noonday sun

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dress down

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae (?)
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her runnin' around

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done

All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Keep-a Truckin'"

Gone astray is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He's sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

[Bridge 1:]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man,
But you can do the job when you're in town.""

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

[Interlude over verse chords]

[Bridge 2:]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though you know, kids are chillin'
We'll frolick & play, the Eskimo way
Just walking in a Winter Wonderland (wo oh oh ...)

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long
The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail
The right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men"

But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted yeah
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
And certain situations scream for deviations
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle
Of this and that and man he should try less
Every time he's rejected man he loses affection

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing
But still find some to spare
And other people got more than they could use
But they don't share
And some people got problems man
They got awful complications
Other people got perfect situations
With no provocation

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you
Confused
What a terrible thing for you to do

It's bad gettin worse ah

Whered all the good people go
Ive been changin channels
I dont see them on the tv shows
Whered all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that and

testing one two,
now whatcha gunna do?
bad news, misused,
got too much to lose
gimme some truth
now whos side are we on?
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob tube
Im in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way, now

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changin channels
I dont see them on the tv shows
Whered all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting round feeling far away
so far away but I can feel the debris
can you feel it?
you interrupt me from a friendly conversation
to tell me how great its all gunna be
you might notice some hesitation
Its important to you is not important to me
Way down by the edge of your reasons
its beginning to show
and all I really wanna know is..

Whered all the good people go
Ive been changin channels
I dont see them on the tv shows
Whered all the good people go
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that
With a rattle a tat
Testing one, two
Man what you gonna do?
Bad news, misused, gimme some truth
You got too much to lose
Whose side are we on?

He just wants to look good for you
So he rushes in to tell you what he did today

I think you listen anyway.

He wants to have a good time
Just like everybody
He doesn't want to fall apart

You watch him as he stutters over what to say
It's just a little game you play
It's no easier for you some days
You wish you could tell him it'll be okay
But you feel a little shy these days
Cause everybody goes away

Oh...
You just want to have a good time
Just like everybody else
You don't want to fall apart this time

I can look into your eyes and see the
Mess we're in
Well darling, if it's shit came out
Then I suppose that it's shit went in
Even though I couldn't say I've been the
Places that you've been

Even if he made my head real thin

I just want to have a good time
Just like everybody
And I don't want to fall apart

I just want to have a good time
Just like everybody else
And I don't want to fall apart this time

Its important to you is not important to me
Way down by the edge of your reasons
its beginning to show

Once in a while
His only answer is one little smile

And no better plan
End it all and let him go
To some better gal
But I'm only human
A coward at best
I'm more than certain
He'd follow me West
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way


Though he loves to work
And slave for me everyday

But why should I leave him
Why should I go

Now theyre light as feathers and youre right in the groove!
You were only hungry for some musical food!
Youre positively absolutely in the mood!

It all goes to show what good a new hit could do!
Never felt so happy and so fully alive!

Lay that pistol down Babe, Lay that pistol down,

She cussed and cried, and said I lied, And I wished that I was dead.

And sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting
To be part of the things you do
Often I've asked you for too much of your time
I've been stealing
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving
Then I reach out, oh baby, then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning
Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside this love I'm yearning, yearning, yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning...

Oooh, burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah
Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside
Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah
Yeah, yeah...

Baby then you
Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside)
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah)
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin', burnin', burnin', burnin')

Yearning, burning, yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning, burning, yearning"

What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so

I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore"

366,Raymond Scott,The Girl At The Typewriter,Pop,"Suffocating eyes and fast hellos and last good-byes
Surround the night of me
Mustache large like smoke from his cigar
Coughs up a joke and laughs a net of sound

Swallowing the pinwheel clowns
Consuming all the women
Like a giant sponge
Snap! The waiters animate
Luxuriate like planets whirling 'round the sun
Collapsing next to me
Shouts don't look sad
Things aren't so bad
They're just more wrong than right
His brandy brim voice whispers
Come with me I hold the key
The city's ours tonight

Heys the barmaid slaps her ass
She shrieks her gold teeth flash
With rapturous delight
Earthquaking the sawdust ground
He grabs my arm and out into the famished night

Now two blazing leaves burning up ground
The tiny waltz of a merry go round
Cascading lights for every heartbeat
Tonight we'll sleep with the girls from the streets

Hurry faster don't look back
His coattails snap his laughter's burning in my ears
I ride upon this giant storm
Through rust-red rooms where shadows breathe from every
board

The world is up for auction sales
A thousand lies descend
The women's tear-tracked cheeks
Still we'll dance them on and on
We can't stop now
Not now until we reach the dawn

Quick give us your lips
Give us your thighs
Give us your sad and devouring eyes
Cascading tears for every heartbeat
Tonight we'll sleep with the girls from the streets"

 As moonlight through the pines

 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you

 Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see

Take him away
Through mirrors dark and blessed with cracks
Through forgotten courtyards
Where you used to search for youth
Old gets a new life
Reach out you can touch it's true
He's not a shadow of shadows
Like you, you see
Hearts hold on holding
If you stay one, you'll stay free
Go seek the lady
Who will give, not take away
Naked with stillness
On the edge of dawn she stays
Night starts to empty
That's when her song begins
She'll make you happy
She'll take you deep within her
Window lights for wanderers
Hide hard in your swollen eyes
Echoes of laughter
Hide in the cities thighs
Love catch these fragments
Swirling through the winds of night
What can it cost
To give a boy child back his sight
Extensions through dimensions
Leave you feeling cold and lame
Boy child mustn't tremble
'cos he came without a name"

There's nothing I can do about it

Those stumblin'words
That told you what my heart meant
A fair ground painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of march that made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you"

Sun showers
Never mind the rain
The sun will shine again
Through sun showers

In a little while
They sky above will srnile
Like luster that follows your kiss

Dark clouds of sorrow
Will soon be a sunny tomorrow

While sun flowers
Raise their happy eyes
Up to the flaming skies
Then sun showers
Leave us as they follow
Rainbows in our hearts

The gray skies soon will clear
My dear
While sun showers are here"

What all you fast talkin' cats would do if you could
You know, I'm ready for the final surprise
There ain't no way around it
Ain't nothing to say
That's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside
All the prayers and surveyors
Keep the whole place uptight
While it keeps on gettin' darker outside

Bet you weren't ready for that
I'm a space cowboy
I'm sure you know where it's at
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I see the show downs, slow downs, lost and found, turn arounds
The boys in the military shirts
I keep my eyes on the prize, on the long fallen skies
And I don't let my friends get hurt
All you back room schemers, small trip dreamers
Better find something new to say
Cause you're the same old story
It's the same old crime
And you got some heavy dues to pay

If I don't return to you.

Hopeful thoughts of soon returning,
can't put out my stomach burning.
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
Unsalted peanuts stretch my miles.

I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm"
388,Billie Holiday,I Can't Get Started - Take 1,Jazz,"Ira Gershwin / Vernon Duke

Iv'e been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good dose it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Even Gabel had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
But what good does it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Even Basic had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you"
389,Artie Shaw,Frenesi,Jazz,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí

She has sent someone along for me

I have waited a long, long time
For somebody to call mine
And at last he's come along
Baby, oh nothing can go wrong

We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'till late
I say to myself each day
Baby, oh long, long live love

True love must be the greatest thing
I know now I sing I sing
Of the moon and stars above
How I long to be in love

We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'till late
I say to myself each day
Baby, oh long, long live love

Now of one thing I'm more than sure
Since love�s come I don't want more
Than to kiss him every night
Makes everything alright

We meet every night at eight
And I don't get home 'till late
I say to myself each day

Memories of you

That have left a rosary of tears

Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond.
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks, O Loch Lomond.

By the steep steep sides of Ben Lomond.
Where deep in purple hue, the highland hills we view.
And the sun coming out in the gloamin'.

Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;

The home of sweet romance,
It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Just like a clinging vine,
So soft and sweet as wine,
So soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never, never, never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;

I've always lost but now I win with you

Cant you see

What love and romance have done to me

Im not the same as I used to be

This is my last affair



Tragedy just seems to be the end of me

My happiness is misery

This is my last affair



Right from the start

You took my love

Tore my heart apart

Now theres nothing new to look forward to

My dreams wont come true



So Ill make a vow, make a vow

No more to loves line will I bow

I cross my heart and feel it now

This is my last affair"
400,Billie Holiday,That's All I Ask of You - Take 1,Jazz,"You've heard my story before
I've often told it you know
Well it's just the same
A dream that's been in vain
Someone to miss when I'm away
Someone to kiss at close of day
A hear that's new
With a love thats true
That's all i ask of you

Someone to care when things look blue
A love to share my whole life through
We're side by side
Just a groom and a bride
Thats all I ask of you

Now most of my plans have crumbled and faded
May this one come true
I'll make a start
I'll give you my hart
The rest is up to you

So give your love
In one sweet kiss
I ask no more of you than this
Be sweet and kind
Say that you'll be mine
That's all I ask of you"
401,Billie Holiday,Everything Happens for the Best,Jazz,"Matt Dennis / Tom Adair

Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
'Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go thru life kust catchin colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measels and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart tho't you could break this jinx for me
that love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castlesin the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too
Your answer was 'Goodbye'
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me"

Wait till the rain stops
Smile through your tears, laughing at liife
No road is lonely, if you will only
Lose all your blues laughing at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away
Start now and cheer up
The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life

Don't mind the rain drops
Wait till the rain stops
You'll find the sun laughing at life
No road is lonely, if you will only
Smile through your tears, laugh at life
Live for tomorrow, be happy today
Laugh all your sorrows away

The skies will clear up
Lose all your blues laughing at life"

Wouldn't give me no dinner

But I had a long, long way to go

Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey

Some tell me baby you're built for speed

Music and Lyrics by Cole Porter
From Seven Lively Arts

Evry time we say goodbye I die a little.
Evry time we say goodbye I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know,
Think so little of me they allow me to go.
When you're near there's such a joy of spring about it.
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it.
there's no love song finer,
But how strange the change from major to minor
Evry time we say goodbye.
Evry single time we say goodbye"

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the rockies may crumble, gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

As I turned to you, you smiled at me; how could we say no?
Whoa, the fun to have! To live the dreams we always had.
Whoa, the songs to sing! When we at last return again.

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss, the devil's in his home.
Whoa, to sail away! Sandy lands and other days.
Whoa, to touch the dream! That hides inside and is never seen, yeah.

Into the sun of south and north at last the birds have flown.
The shackles of commitment fell in pieces on the ground.
Whoa, to ride the wind! To tread the air above the din.
Whoa, to laugh aloud! Dancing high above the crowd.

Seek the man whose pointing hand the giant step unfolds.
With guidance from the curving path that churns up into stone!
If one bell should ring, celebration for a king.
So fast the heart should beat, as proud the head with heavy feet, yeah.

[Solo]

Days went by when you and I made an eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant, our mutual time to grow.
Whoa, the sweet refrain! It soothes the soul and calms the pain.
Oh, Albion remains! Sleeping now to rise again.

Wandering the wanderings. What place to rest the search?
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
From the earth!

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.

Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!"

oooh...tryin hard to change but can't let go
oooh...cryin' tears of pain and more and more
oooh...everyday is the same as the one before

I'm walkin the floor over you
I'm walkin the floor

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
To the hand that takes your dreamless soul

Ooh...Is it long to wait, is it much to pay?
oooh...Sometimes it's hard waiting for the day.

you know it's hard. I said it's hard
You know it's true. I said it's hard
you know it's hard. You know it's true

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Every love that's changed ?-?-?-?-?-?
In the eye of the night ?-?-?-
In the day everything ?-?-?-?
She was smilin' a tear at her waters fall ??

you know it's true. You know it's true now

When I used to play
There was a time when I used to play
But take me now, baby, don't worry about later
Teach the dance I used to do
They call it the Mashed Potato

There was a day, now dig this
There was a day, they call it the Jerk
Everybody relax and watch me work

In my hometown where I used to stay
The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together in time, for rhythm with you
So come and walk

There was a day that I used to do
The name of the dance
They call it Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler
I do the best that I can do

There was a time, sometimes I dance
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet
Until you see me do the James Brown"
415,Lead Belly,Where Did You Sleep Last Night,Folk,"It was an April morning when they told us we should go.
As I turned to you, you smiled at me; how could we say no?
Whoa, the fun to have! To live the dreams we always had.
Whoa, the songs to sing! When we at last return again.

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss, the devil's in his home.
Whoa, to sail away! Sandy lands and other days.
Whoa, to touch the dream! That hides inside and is never seen, yeah.

Into the sun of south and north at last the birds have flown.
The shackles of commitment fell in pieces on the ground.
Whoa, to ride the wind! To tread the air above the din.
Whoa, to laugh aloud! Dancing high above the crowd.

Seek the man whose pointing hand the giant step unfolds.
With guidance from the curving path that churns up into stone!
If one bell should ring, celebration for a king.
So fast the heart should beat, as proud the head with heavy feet, yeah.

[Solo]

Days went by when you and I made an eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant, our mutual time to grow.
Whoa, the sweet refrain! It soothes the soul and calms the pain.
Oh, Albion remains! Sleeping now to rise again.

Wandering the wanderings. What place to rest the search?
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
From the earth!

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.

Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!"
416,Glenn Miller,Chattanooga Choo Choo,Jazz,"Hi there Tex, what you say
Step aside partner, it's my day
Bend an ear & listen to my version
Of a really solid Tennesse excursion

Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
Yes yes track twenty-nine
Boy, you can gimme a shine
Can you afford
To board the Chattanooga choo choo
I've got my fare
And just a trifle to spare

You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner
Nothing could be finer
Then to have your ham an' eggs in Carolina

When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in
Gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga there you are

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace
I used to call ""funny face""
She's gonna cry
Until I tell her that I'll never roam
So Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you choo-choo me home?
Chattanooga Chattanooga
Get aboard
Chattanooga Chattanooga
All Aboard
Chattanooga Chattanooga
Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you choo-choo me home?
Chatanooga Choo Choo"

And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are
far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere, over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow

419,Glenn Miller,Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (with Anyone Else but Me),Jazz,"- written by Lew Brown, Charles Tobias and Sam H. Stept
- lyrics as recorded in New York City on February 18, 1942 by
Glenn Miller and His Orchestra (two months after the attack
on Pearl Harbor). The male vocals on the recording were by
Ray Eberle and the Modernaires. The female vocals were by
Marion Hutton (Betty Hutton's sister).

{male vocals}
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

Don't go walkin' down Lover's Lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't go walkin' down Lover's Lane with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

I just got word from a guy who heard from the guy next door to me
The girl he met just loves to pet and it fits you to-a-tee
So, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marchin' home

{female vocals}
Don't give out with those lips of yours to anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Watch the girls on the foreign shores, you'll have to report to me
When you come marchin' home

Don't hold anyone on your knee, you better be true to me
You better be true to me, you better be true to me
Don't hold anyone on your knee, you're gettin' the third degree
When you come marchin' home

You're on your own where there is no phone and I can't keep tab on you
Be fair to me, I'll guarantee this is one thing that I'll do
I won't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but you
Till you come marchin' home

{all}
Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
I know the apple tree is reserved for you and me
And I'll be true till you come marchin' home"

Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip
Can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah

Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill

Hey baby, whoa baby, pretty baby
Darlin' makes 'em do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me like you're doin' now

Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out

Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star

I don't know, but I been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ah, ah, ah

All I ask for, all I pray
A steady rollin' woman gonna come my way

Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

421,Benny Goodman,Goodbye,Jazz,"Evry Time We Say Goodbye
Benny Goodman
Music and Lyrics by Cole Porter
From Seven Lively Arts

Evry time we say goodbye I die a little.
Evry time we say goodbye I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know,
Think so little of me they allow me to go.
When you're near there's such a joy of spring about it.
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it.
there's no love song finer,
But how strange the change from major to minor
Evry time we say goodbye.
Evry single time we say goodbye"
422,Harry James,I Had The Craziest Dream,Jazz,"There you stand in your dungarees,
lookin all grown up and so very pleased.
When you write your poems they have so much to say,
when you speak your dreams it takes my breath away.
Ya know I wanna be a ball player,
a regular sluggin fool.
But I guess our dreams must wait awhile,
until we finish school.

{Chorus}
And so you and I,
we watch our years go by.
We watch our sweet dreams fly far away (away) but maybe someday,
I don't know when,
but we will dream again
and we'll be happy then until our time just drifts away.

There you stand in your wedding dress,
you're so beautiful I must confess
I m so proud you have chosen me,
when a doctor is what you wanna be.
Ya know I wanna be a painter girl,
a real artistic snob.
But I guess we'll have our children first,
you'll find a home I'll get a job.

{chorus}

Listen the seasons passing, listen to the wind blow.
Listen to the children laughing, where do broken dreams go?

There you stand in your tailored suit,
so many years gone by, but your still so cute.
You take the car to go and meet the bus,
when our grandchildren come to visit us.
And you say you shoula been a ballerina babe,
there are songs I shoulda sung,
But I guess our dreams have come and gone.
You're supposed to dream when you are young.

{Chorus}"
423,Glenn Miller,Stairway to the Stars,Jazz,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you"

Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love

What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another, I can't have another for I'm not free

She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in bitterness"

Is it an evil sign?
Is it a people

leaving you behind?
Is it a bad day
for human kind?
Is it a prophet
with a one track mind?
Is it a finish?
Is it a fearful find?
Is it the center
as your world unwinds?

And if I can’t hear the music
And the audience is gone
I’ll dance here on my own.
And I hope the lonely hearts club band
Will play out one last song
Before the sun goes down.

And there she goes
And there she goes

And is it evil?
Should it really make you sick?
Is now the time that you realize
you’d better get out quick?
And is it envy
Or pride that makes them vain?
Did you give your all
But you’re only small
And now your body’s drained?
This is never gonna stop.
They will never let you go.
You're in a rush.
They don’t care enough.
’Cause their lives are very slow.
Time is ticking on.
Too long to fake your smile.
But then you sold your soul for a leading role
So wear it for a while.

And if I can’t hear the music
And the audience is gone
I’ll dance here on my own.
And I hope the lonely hearts club band
Will play out one last song

And you're right to be afraid

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Lawd you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh the Rock Island Line is a mighty fine line
Oh the Rock Island Line is the road to ride
If you want to ride, you gotta ride it like you're flyin'
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line

Jesus died to save our sins
Glory to God I'm gonna see Him again
Oh the Rock Island Line is a mighty fine line
Oh the Rock Island Line is the road to ride
If you want to ride, you gotta ride it like you're flyin'
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line

Moses stood on the Red Sea shore
Smothin' the water with a two-by-four
Oh the Rock Island Line is a mighty fine line
Oh the Rock Island Line is the road to ride
If you want to ride, you gotta ride it like you're flyin'
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line"

Artie Shaw
Music and Lyrics by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz
From The Band Wagon

Dancing in the dark,
Till the tune end
Were dancing in the dark,
And it soon ends.
Were waltzing in the wonder
Of why were here;
Time hurries by,
Were here and gone.
Looking for the light
Of a new love
To brighten up the night.
I have you to love,
And we can face the music together;
Dancing in the dark.

What though love is old?
What though song is old?
Through them we can be young.
Hear this heart of mine
Make yours part of mine.
Dear one, tell me that were one!
Dancing in the dark!

Asked sweet mama, Let me be her kid
She said, &amp;quot;You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid&amp;quot;

Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark

Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, &amp;quot;is really sloppy drunk&amp;quot;
I know my mama, Lord, a brownskin, but she ain't no plum

See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone
See my baby, Tell hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone

Hey, she promises, She's my rider
I wanna tell you, She's my rider
I know you're mine, She's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider

I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when

Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen

She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time

Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg

Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed

As I turned to you, you smiled at me; how could we say no?
Whoa, the fun to have! To live the dreams we always had.
Whoa, the songs to sing! When we at last return again.

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss, the devil's in his home.
Whoa, to sail away! Sandy lands and other days.
Whoa, to touch the dream! That hides inside and is never seen, yeah.

Into the sun of south and north at last the birds have flown.
The shackles of commitment fell in pieces on the ground.
Whoa, to ride the wind! To tread the air above the din.
Whoa, to laugh aloud! Dancing high above the crowd.

Seek the man whose pointing hand the giant step unfolds.
With guidance from the curving path that churns up into stone!
If one bell should ring, celebration for a king.
So fast the heart should beat, as proud the head with heavy feet, yeah.

[Solo]

Days went by when you and I made an eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant, our mutual time to grow.
Whoa, the sweet refrain! It soothes the soul and calms the pain.
Oh, Albion remains! Sleeping now to rise again.

Wandering the wanderings. What place to rest the search?
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
Where the mighty arms of Atlas hold the heavens from the earth!
From the earth!

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way.

Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, Always knew what's goin on
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's done, been lazin' out in the noonday sun

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dress down

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae (?)
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her runnin' around

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done

All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Stay away from me
Dengue woman
Stay away from me
You got your fever and you rush
Over me

That's why
Everyday you bring me misery
Everyday you give me misery
I think about jumpin'
Jumpin' in the deep blue see

You got me all crazy
I can't get outta bed
Bones are achin'
(?) in my head
Dengue woman
Stay away from me
I've got your aches and things
Over me"
461,Harry James,Ciribiribin (They're So In Love),Jazz,"first recorded by writer Columbo in 1932
Words by Leo Robin and Music by Russ Columbo and Clarence Gaskill

Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love

What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another, I can't have another for I'm not free

She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love

&lt;brief instrumental interlude&gt;

What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another, I can't have another for I'm not free

She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love

462,Glenn Miller,Stairway to the Stars / To You - Live,Jazz,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you"
463,Sonny Boy Williamson I,Good Gravy,Blues,"I, I love the colorful clothes she wears

464,Lead Belly,In New Orleans,Folk,"One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite.

A man I know, went down to Louisiana,
had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna,
He kissed the whiskers, left & right
Whiskers!

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter, our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set the room alight.
Whiskers!

Down on Bourbon street, You know it's right
You can see my friend, they run around all through the night
Most everywhere, Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor, Doin' up my hair

New Orleans queens, Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite."

What did you bring me, to keep me from the gallows pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming, riding a many mile
Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the gallows pole?

Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah, I brought a little gold
I brought a little of everything to keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you, to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming, riding a many mile, mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
And ride for many mile, mile, mile

Oh, yes, you got a fine sister, she warmed my blood from cold
She brought my blood to boiling hot to keep you from the gallows pole
Your brother brought me silver, and your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, pole, pole

Swingin' on the gallows pole

Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time, yes it has

Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Oh, seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Makin' vows that just can't work right

I love my man, tell the world I do

Makes me feel so blue

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey

Makes me everthing a good man needs"

But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to control you
And like the other little children you gotta dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin' or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you
It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know that I love you
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to console you
And when you go out to play this evening play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover and play with real fire till the dawn
It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know that I love you
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to console you"
469,Lead Belly,Good Morning Blues,Folk,"In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
Now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone, I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
I feel good when I look into your eyes"

473,Count Basie,I Want a Little Girl,Jazz,"She comes out on Fridays every time
Stands out in a line
I could've been anyone she'd seen
She waits another week to fall apart
She couldn't make another day
I wish it was anyone but me
I could have been anyone you see
She had something breakable just under her skin

American girls, all weather & noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible

She comes out of closets every night
But then she locks herself away
Where she could keep everything from me
I could have been anyone you see
She's nothing but porcelain underneath
her skin

American girls, all weather & noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle right up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible

Little shivers shaking me every day
But I could get the same thing anywhere
So if she goes away
Well, it's all right and I'm ok
Hey, she said, Come back again tonight,
And I said I might, I might, I might,
She said well that's all right.
If it's alright, if it's alright with you,
Then it's alright, it's alright with me.

I waited for an hour last Friday night
She never came around
She took almost everything from me
I'm going through my closet,
Trying on her clothes almost every day
I could've been anyone you see
I wish it was anyone but me
There's nothing but pills and ashes
Under my skin

American girls, all weather & noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle right up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible

If I made you cry, please tell me why
Cause I'll try again if you let me try
American girls all feathers & cream
Coming into bed so edible

488,Peggy Lee,Not Care In the World,Jazz,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life - I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger


Lucky me, can't you see - I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let her go"

490,Peggy Lee,Shady Lady Bird,Jazz,"I've been where the eagle flies
Rode his wings 'cross autumn skies
Kissed the sun, touched the moon
But he left me much too soon.
His lady bird...He left his lady bird

Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would.
You lady bird...pretty lady bird

Lightning flashed across the sky
The night he taught me how to fly
The sun came up and then I found
Too soon he let his lady down.
His lady bird...I'm his lady bird

Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would.
You lady bird...pretty lady bird

Winter lives in my heart
In the times we're apart
Summer sings a song or two
When he says ""I love you true"".
My lady bird...yeah, I'm his lady bird

Lady bird come on down
I'm here waiting on the ground
Lady bird I'll treat you good
Aw, lady bird I wish you would.
You lady bird...Pretty lady bird (I'm your lady bird)
You're a lady bird (Yes, I'm a lady bird)
You're too much you little bird."

I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, I'm in the mood for love
I said night time is the right time, to be with the one you love
You know when night come baby, God know, you're so far away
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood, baby, in the mood for love
I said yes, my mama told me, to leave that girl alone
But my mama didn't know, God know, girl was puttin' down
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, in the mood for love"
493,Peggy Lee,When the Roses Bloom Again,Jazz,"The news is out all over town

That you've been seen out runnin' around

I know that I should leave, but then

I just can't go,

You win again

This heart of mine could never see

what everybody knows but me

Just trusting in you was my great sin

What can I do?

You Win Again

Yes this heart of mine could never see

what everybody knows but me

Just trusting you was my great sin

What can I do?

You Win Again"
494,Peggy Lee,You're Easyto Dance With,Jazz,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance,
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin',
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter,
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone.)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,

Dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance..

I wanna roll you baby, roll you all over town
Wanna roll with you baby, roll you all over town

496,Lena Horne,Let Me Love You,Jazz,"Hey baby, won't you love me or leave me
Or let me be lonely.
You won't believe me, but I love you only.

I'd rather be lonely than be happy with somebody else.

You might find the night time
The right time for kissing,
But night time is my time
For just reminiscing.

Regretting instead of forgetting
With somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you.
I intend to be independently blue.

I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
To have it today
And to give back tomorrow

For my love is your love.
And no love for nobody else.

There'll be no one unless that someone is you.
You better know it.
I intend to be independently blue.
And I'll show it.

I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
Have it today
And to give back tomorrow
Log on to kill this message.

It's my love for your love
And no love for nobody else.
Yes my love is your love
And no love for nobody else."

498,Sonny Boy Williamson I,New Early In The Morning,Blues,"New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

When you're a boy, some days are tough
Lying on your bed playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp you gotta escape
Wanna go and wander in the ticker tape

You feel, the deal, is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
Into New York City

New York City boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

The street is amazing
The hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware at the latest deal
Hear a song, that's the bomb
If you don't get that mix it's gone 86

You feel, the deal, is real
you're in New York City

New York City boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

Then as evening falls
You can return it's calls
(Party on, party on, party on, p-party on
Party on, party on, party on, p-party on
Party on, party on, party on, p-party on
Party on, party on, party on, p-party on)

You feel, the deal, is real

499,Sonny Boy Williamson I,Life Time Blues,Blues,"I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times"
